<h1>From Perl to Pi</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 15 Apr 2008</div>
<p>
  I was learning Perl last weekend from the book <em>Learning
  Perl</em>, 3rd Edition by Randal L. Schwartz and Tom Phoenix.  While
  reading the book, I came across these lines:
</p>
<blockquote>
  It's easier to type <code>$pi</code> than \( \pi, \) especially if
  you don't have Unicode.  And it will be easy to maintain the program
  in case the value of \( \pi \) ever changes.<sup>379</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The corresponding footnote mentions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>
    <sup>379</sup> It nearly did change by a legislative act in the
    state of Indiana.
    <a href="http://www.urbanlegends.com/legal/pi_indiana.htm">http://www.urbanlegends.com/legal/pi_indiana.htm</a>
  </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I searched the web and found that the original urbanlegends.com
  website is no longer there.  However while searching for it, I came
  across this brilliant piece of humour archived in the article titled
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alabamas-slice-of-pi/">Alabama's
  Slice of Pi</a> on Snopes.  It is a fictitious report on a state
  legislature redefining the value of \( \pi \) to 3.
</p>
<p>
  The Snopes artile mentions that this piece of humour was first
  posted in a newsgroup.  Then people started circulating it as hoax
  from there.  Here are some of the intriguing and funny bits from it:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Lawson called into question the usefulness of any number that cannot
  be calculated exactly, and suggested that never knowing the exact
  answer could harm students' self-esteem.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Scientists have arbitrarily assumed that space is Euclidean, he
  says.  He points out that a circle drawn on a spherical surface has
  a different value for the ratio of circumfence to diameter.
</blockquote>
<p>
  In fact, with a little geometry we can see that if a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland">flatlander</a>
  living on a globe with diameter \( D \) draws a circle of diameter
  \( d \) assuming that he is on a flat surface, then the ratio of the
  circumference \( c \) to the diameter \( d \) is

  \[
    \frac{c}{d} = \frac{\pi D}{d} \sin{\frac{d}{D}}.
  \]

  Here are a few more excerpts from the Snopes article:
</p>
<blockquote>
  "These nabobs waltzed into the capital with an arrogance that was
  breathtaking," Learned said.  "Their prefatorial deficit resulted in
  a polemical stance at absolute contraposition to the legislature's
  puissance."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  One member of the state school board, Lily Ponja, is anxious to get
  the new value of pi into the state's math textbooks, but thinks that
  the old value should be retained as an alternative.  She said, "As
  far as I am concerned, the value of pi is only a theory, and we
  should be open to all interpretations."  She looks forward to
  students having the freedom to decide for themselves what value pi
  should have.
</blockquote>
<p>
  By the way, the real event that the footnote in the
  <em>Learning Perl</em> book mentioned is
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill">Indiana
  Pi Bill</a>.
