<h1>Flowers</h1>

  This is my third attempt at composing music.  I composed, played and
  recorded it almost a year before publishing it.  It took about a
  year to publish it because it took me time to write the sheet music.

<p>
  This piece consists of 161 measures.  It is approximately 3 minutes
  8 seconds long.

  Most of the music emerged naturally from my mind while thinking
  about roadside fields with wild plants and flowers.  Some of the
  bass notes did not come out naturally and I decided them, quite
  artificially, to fill the music with a pleasant and peaceful mood.
  It took me a couple of days to compose this.  I played and recorded
  this after a day of practice.
