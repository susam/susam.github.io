<h1>A Few Notes</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 18 Jul 2010</div>
<p>
  This is a very short piece I composed in December 2009 when I began
  learning to play musical keyboard.  After about 3 hours of music
  lessons, I came up with a very simple single track piece.  In the
  next few days, I added more tracks to the piece which resulted in
  this piece.
</p>
<p>
  The composition is very short and simple.  It consists of 29
  measures.  The duration of this piece is 53 seconds approximately.
  It is composed of 5 tracks.  I played and recorded the 5 tracks
  separately on my Yamaha keyboard.  The tracks are: piano (hypetine),
  harp, strings, nylon guitar and standard percussion kit.
</p>
<p>
  The music was recorded as an MP3 file with
  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> after
  connecting the musical keyboard's output jack to the laptop's
  line-in jack using a cable with 3.5 mm stereo plug at both ends.  A
  3.5 mm stereo jack to 6.35 mm stereo adapter was used to connect the
  3.5 mm (approximately &#x215b;") stereo plug to the keyboard's 6.35
  mm (&frac14;") stereo jack.

  Most of the piece was written as a learning exercise for myself.
  The 4th track containing arpeggios from nylon guitar is meant to
  play hide and seek with the main track and sound happy.
</p>
<p>
  The 2nd (harp) and 5th (percussion) tracks are missing from the
  sheet music because I couldn't find a way to add a track for harp in
  LilyPond and I don't know the music notation for percussion kit.
  I'm not very good at music notation.  So, there may be notation
  errors in the sheet music but it is good enough to remind me the
  notes of this piece in case I ever forget them.
