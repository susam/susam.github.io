<h1>From Web Feed Entry to 186k Hits</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 07 Apr 2024</div>
<p>
  Last Sunday (31 Mar 2024), I published a tiny colour guessing game
  called <a href="myrgb.html">Guess My RGB</a>.  I developed most of
  it on Saturday afternoon, took a break and revisited it later that
  night for some final code cleanup.  Around 02:00 UTC, I uploaded the
  game to my website.  Since the entire game is contained in a single
  HTML file named <a href="myrgb.html">myrgb.html</a>, it was just a
  matter of uploading this file to my web server.  Shortly after, I
  went to bed.
</p>
<p>
  I had no intention of sharing this game with a wide audience yet, as
  it hadn't been thoroughly tested.  However, when I woke up the next
  morning, I discovered that a Hacker News (HN) user had already found
  and shared the game on HN in this post:
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018">news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Since I had not shared this game with anyone anywhere yet, I was
  quite surprised to wake up Sunday morning and find my game trending
  at the top of HN.  I believe this is where maintaining an RSS feed
  on my website might have helped.  Every new page that I publish on
  this website also appears as an entry in the RSS feed for this
  website.  This feed can be found here:
  <a href="feed.xml">feed.xml</a>.  I have a few hundred subscribers
  to this feed.  It is very likely that the HN user who shared this
  game on HN found it through this feed.  Indeed my web server logs
  show that the feed was fetched by a feed reader just minutes before
  the game was posted on HN.
</p>
<p>
  In the week since its HN mention, my game has received a total of
  186,850 hits.  Not a staggering number but encouraging!  The actual
  numbers for each day look like this:
</p>
<!-- 95467 + 48330 + 22305 + 10189 + 4685 + 2101 + 3773 = 186850 -->
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Hits</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>31 Mar 2024</td>
    <td>95467</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>01 Apr 2024</td>
    <td>48330</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>02 Apr 2024</td>
    <td>22305</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>03 Apr 2024</td>
    <td>10189</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>04 Apr 2024</td>
    <td>4685</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>05 Apr 2024</td>
    <td>2101</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>06 Mar 2024</td>
    <td>3773</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  So the next time someone tells you that RSS is dead, remember how an
  RSS feed entry helped my little game get discovered.  It took only
  one entry in my web feed, one generous subscriber and a handful of
  HN upvotes to reach a large audience!  It is a good reminder that
  simple, open web tools still work well and sometimes they work
  surprisingly well.
