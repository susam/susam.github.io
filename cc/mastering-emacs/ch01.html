<h1>Notes on Mastering Emacs: Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 16 Dec 2022</div>
<p>
  The following notes were taken while discussing Chapter 1 of the
  book <em>Mastering Emacs</em> by Mickey Petersen (2022 edition) in
  <a href="./">book discussion group meetings</a>.
</p>
<p>
  An index of notes for all chapters are available
  at <a href="notes.html">notes.html</a>.

<h2 id="describe-system">Describe System<a href="#describe-system"></a></h2>
<p>
  To get a glimpse of the powerful describe system available in Emacs,
  type the following key sequence: <code>C-h C-k C-p</code>.  This
  shows the documentation associated with the keys
  sequence <code>C-p</code> that invokes the command
  named <code>previous-line</code> to move the cursor to the previous
  line.  The documentation mentions that this command is defined in a
  file named <code>simple.el</code>.  Click on the file name to jump
  straight into the source code of <code>simple.el</code> where this
  command is defined.  With Emacs, the source code of Emacs is not
  hidden from the user.  The describe system is discussed in Chapter 3
  of the book.
</p>
<h2 id="language-servers">Language Servers<a href="#language-servers"></a></h2>
<p>
  The two popular language server implementations for Emacs are LSP
  Mode and Eglot.  Since Emacs 29, Eglot is part of Emacs core and
  does not require installing a separate package.  It can be run with
  the key sequence <code>M-x eglot RET</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="baroque-terminology">Baroque Terminology<a href="#baroque-terminology"></a></h2>
<p>
  Some examples are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The term <em>point</em> to refer to the cursor.
  </li>
  <li>
    The term <em>yank</em> to paste text.  What can be especially
    confusing for users with prior Vim experience is that Vim uses the
    term <em>yank</em> to mean copying text but Emacs uses this term
    to mean pasting text.
  </li>
  <li>
    An OS-level or desktop-environment-level window is known
    as <em>frame</em> in Emacs.  We can split an Emacs frame into
    multiple panes and these panes are called <em>windows</em> in
    Emacs.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are many more such examples.  The above examples illustrate
  the kind of surprises one should be ready for while reading Emacs
  documentation.  Fortunately, it is often possible to understand the
  meaning of these terms from the context.
</p>
<h2 id="active-friendly-community">Active, Friendly Community<a href="#active-friendly-community"></a></h2>
<p>
  There are three good places to hang out with other Emacs users, seek
  help or help others with Emacs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">r/emacs</a>
    community.
  </li>
  <li>
    Libera <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#emacs">#emacs</a>
    channel.
  </li>
  <li>
    Matrix <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#emacs:matrix.org">#emacs</a>
    room.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All three places appear to be quite friendly to beginners to Emacs!
</p>
<h2 id="vim-emulation-layer">Vim Emulation Layer<a href="#vim-emulation-layer"></a></h2>
<p>
  The most popular Vim emulation layer these days is Evil Mode.  It is
  often said that the best implementation of Vim is written in Emacs
  Lisp.  Some people also claim that Evil Mode is a better Vim than
  Vim itself.  In fact, the next chapter, i.e. Chapter 3, says the
  following:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Vim users are migrating to Emacs because, well, Emacs is often a
  better Vim than Vim.
</blockquote>
<h2 id="links">Links<a href="#links"></a></h2>
<p>
  The following list includes some links that were discussed during
  the book discussion group meetings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful">Helpful</a> is an
    alternative to the built-in Emacs help that provides much more
    contextual information.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/xuchunyang/elisp-demos">Elisp API
    Demos</a> injects Elisp demo examples in <code>*Help*</code>
    buffers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a> is a
    feed aggregrator for Emacs-related blogs.
</ul>
