<h1>My Blogroll Is Now My Feed Reader</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 05 Jul 2025</div>
<p>
  On a particularly hot summer weekend last month, I implemented a new
  feature for this website: a blogroll that lists recent entries from
  my favourite blogs.  Check it out here: <a href="roll.html">roll.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It has been nearly two weeks since I set up this blogroll and it has
  already changed how I keep up with my feeds.  I no longer bother
  with feed readers or aggregators.  I could never quite make a habit
  of using them regularly anyway.  Thanks to this simple addition to
  my website, I find myself visiting my blogroll often.  It has earned
  a permanent place in my bookmarks.  When I have some spare time, I
  click on the bookmark, visit my blogroll and, when I find new posts
  appear there, I click through and read the full blog posts.
</p>
<p>
  Credit for this nifty and surprisingly effective idea goes to Alex
  Kladov.  It was Alex's website,
  <a href="https://matklad.github.io/">matklad.github.io</a>, that
  inspired me to implement my own blogroll.  It showed me that a
  blogroll can be more than just a static list of links.  It can be a
  regularly updated page that highlights new posts from the blogs I
  follow.
</p>
<p>
  I suspect the fact that my blogroll is generated by my own
  handcrafted <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/main/roll.lisp">Common
  Lisp program</a> plays a part in why I enjoy using it.  There is a
  certain joy in using something you have built yourself.  At last, I
  feel I can stay on top of my feeds!  If you maintain a personal
  website and struggle to keep up with your feeds, I recommend this
  approach.  Writing the blogroll generator was a fun weekend project
  and it has greatly improved how I spend my spare time online!
