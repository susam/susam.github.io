<h1>FXYT 0.2.0</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 24 Dec 2023</div>
<p>
  FXYT 0.2.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, stack-oriented, canvas
  colouring language written in postfix notation with only 36 simple
  commands.  This update specifies and implements a much stricter
  definition of the <code>F</code> command that sets the frame
  interval.  The problem with the earlier definition as well as
  implementation was that the <code>F</code> command was evaluated for
  every cell in the canvas and the frame interval was set for every
  such interval.  This meant that the frame interval that would be set
  for the next frame would depend on the order in which the evaluation
  occurred.  See section
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/fxyt#frame-interval">Frame
  Interval</a> of the README for the complete details.
</p>
<p>
  This update now ensures that a coordinate-dependent frame interval
  set with the <code>F</code> command behaves uniformly across any
  implementation of FXYT regardless of the order of evaluation.  This
  is done by ensuring that while the command <code>F</code> is
  evaluated for all cells, it is only the frame interval value found
  during the evaluation of cell (0, 0) that is honoured as the frame
  interval for the next frame.

  The new update is now available at

  try it out and play with it.  If you come up with any interesting
  demos, please do
