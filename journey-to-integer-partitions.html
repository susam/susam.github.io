<h1>Journey to Integer Partitions</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 18 Sep 2021</div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>
  After <a href="cc/iant/log.html#114">114 meetings</a> and 75 hours
  of studying together, our analytic number theory book discussion
  group has finally reached the final chapter of the
  book <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> by Apostol
  (1976).  We have less than 18 pages to read in order to complete
  reading this book.  Considering that we meet 3-4 times in a week and
  we discuss about 2-3 pages in every meeting, it appears that we
  would be able to complete reading this book in another 2 weeks.
</p>
<p>
  Reading this book has been quite a journey!  The previous three
  posts on this blog provide an account of how this journey has been.
  It has been fun, of course.  The best part of hosting a book
  discussion group like this has been the number of extremely smart
  people I got an opportunity to meet and interact with.  The insights
  and comments on the study material that others shared during the
  meetings were very helpful.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="cc/iant/log.html">meeting log</a> shows that our
  meetings started really small with only 4 participants in the first
  meeting in March 2021 and then it gradually grew to about 10-12
  regular members within a month.  Then a few months later, the number
  of participants began dwindling a little.  This happened because
  some members of the group had to drop out as they got busy with
  other personal or professional engagements.  However, six months
  later, we still have about 4-5 regular participants meeting
  consistently.  I think it is pretty good that we have made it this
  far.

  The final chapter on integer partitions is very unlike all the
  previous 12 chapters.  While the previous chapters dealt
  with <em>multiplicative number theory</em>, this final chapter deals
  with <em>additive number theory</em>.  For example, the first
  theorem talks about an interesting property of <em>unrestricted
  partitions</em>.  We study the number of ways a positive integer can
  be expressed as a sum of positive integers.  The number of summands
  is unrestricted, repetition of summands is allowed and the order of
  the summands is not taken into account.  For example, the number 3
  has 3 partitions: 3, 2 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1.  Similarly, the number 4
  has 5 partitions: 4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.
</p>
<p>
  I have always wanted to learn about partitions more deeply, so I am
  quite happy that this book ends with a chapter on partitions.  The
  subject of partitions is rich with very interesting results obtained
  by various accomplished mathematicians.  In the book, the first
  theorem about partitions is a very simple one that follows from the
  geometric representation of partitions.  Let us see an illustration
  first.
</p>
<p>
  How many partitions of 6 are there?  There are 11 partitions of 6.
  They are 6, 5 + 1, 4 + 2, 4 + 1 + 1, 3 + 3, 3 + 2 + 1, 3 + 1 + 1 +
  1, 2 + 2 + 2, 2 + 2 + 1 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
  + 1.  Now how many of these partitions are made up of 5 parts?  Each
  summand is called a part.  The answer is 2.  There are 2 partitions
  of 6 that are made up of 5 parts.  They are 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 2 + 2
  + 1 + 1.  Let us represent both these partitions as arrangements of
  lattice points.  Here is the representation of the partition 3 + 1 +
  1 + 1:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&bull; &bull; &bull;
&bull;
&bull;
&bull;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now if we read this arrangement from left to right, column by
  column, we get another partition of 6, i.e. 4 + 1 + 1.  Note that
  the number of parts in 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 (i.e. 4) appears as the largest
  part in 4 + 1 + 1.  Similarly, the number of parts in 4 + 1 + 1
  (i.e. 3) appears as the largest part in 3 + 1 + 1 + 1.  Let us see
  one more example of this relationship.  Here is the geometric
  representation of 2 + 2 + 1 + 1:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&bull; &bull;
&bull; &bull;
&bull;
&bull;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Once again, reading this representation from left to right, we get 4
  + 2, another partition of 6.  Once again, we can see that the number
  of partitions in 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 (i.e. 4) appears as the largest part
  in 4 + 2 and vice versa.  These observations lead to the first
  theorem in the chapter on partitions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Theorem 14.1</strong>
  <em>
    The number ofpartitions of \( n \)
    into \( m \) parts is equal to the number of partitions of \( n \)
    into parts, the largest of which is \( m.  \)
  </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
  That was a brief introduction to the chapter on partitions.  In the
  next two or so weeks, we will dive deeper into the theory of
  partitions.

  If this blog post was fun for you, consider joining our next
  meeting.  Our next meeting is on Tue, 21 Sep 2021 at 17:00 UTC.
  Since we are at the beginning of a new chapter, it is a good time
  for new participants to join us.  It is also a good time for members
  who have been away for a while to join us back.  Since this chapter
  does not depend much on the previous chapters, new participants
  should be able to join our reading sessions for this chapter and
  follow along easily without too much effort.

<p>
  It is worth mentioning here that lurking is absolutely fine in our
  meetings.  In fact, most participants of our meetings join in and
  stay silent throughout the meeting.  Only a few members talk via
  audio/video or chat.  This is considered absolutely normal in our
  meetings, so please do not hesitate to join our meetings!
