<h1>Leap Year Test in K&amp;R</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 29 Feb 2020</div>
<p>
  About 18 years ago, while learning to program a computer using C, I
  learnt the following test for leap year from the book <em>The C
  Programming Language, 2nd ed.</em> (K&amp;R) written by Brian
  Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.  Section 2.5 (Arithmetic Operators) of
  the book uses the following test:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0</code>
</pre>
<p>
  It came as a surprise to me.  Prior to reading this, I did not know
  that centurial years are not leap years except for those centurial
  years that are also divisible by 400.  Until then, I always
  incorrectly thought that all years divisible by 4 are leap years.  I
  have witnessed only one centurial year, namely the year 2000, which
  happens to be divisible by 400.  As a result, the year 2000 proved
  to be a leap year and my misconception remained unchallenged for
  another few years until I finally came across the above test in
  K&amp;R.
</p>
<p>
  Now that I understand that centurial years are not leap years unless
  divisible by 400, it is easy to confirm this with the
  Unix <code>cal</code> command.  Enter <code>cal 1800</code>
  or <code>cal 1900</code> and we see calendars of non-leap years.
  But enter <code>cal 2000</code> and we see the calendar of a leap
  year.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, the following leap year test is equally effective:
</p>
<pre>
<code>year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0)</code>
</pre>

  <strong>Update:</strong> In the
  <a href="comments/leap-year-test-in-knr.html">comments section</a>,
  Thaumasiotes explains why both tests work.  Let me take the liberty
  of elaborating that comment further with a truth table.  We use the
  notation <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>
  respectively, for the three comparisons in the above expressions.
  Then the two tests above can be expressed as the following boolean
  expressions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>(A &amp;&amp; B) || C</code></li>
  <li><code>A &amp;&amp; (B || C)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now normally these two boolean expressions are not equivalent.  The
  truth table below shows this:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th><code>A</code></th>
    <th><code>B</code></th>
    <th><code>C</code></th>
    <th><code>(A &amp;&amp; B) || C</code></th>
    <th><code>A &amp;&amp; (B || C)</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  We see that there are two cases where the last two columns differ.
  This confirms that the two boolean expressions are not equivalent.
  The two cases where the boolean expressions yield different results
  occur when <code>A</code> is false and <code>C</code> is true.  But
  these cases are impossible!  If <code>A</code> is false
  and <code>C</code> is true, it means we have <code>year % 4 !=
  0</code> and <code>year % 400 == 0</code> which is impossible.
</p>
<p>
  If <code>year % 400 == 0</code> is true, then <code>year % 4 ==
  0</code> must also hold true.  In other words, if <code>C</code> is
  true, <code>A</code> must also be true.  Therefore, the two cases
  where the last two columns differ cannot occur and may be ignored.
  The last two columns are equal in all other cases and that is why
  the two tests we have are equivalent.
