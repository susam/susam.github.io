<h1>When Worse Is Better</h1>

<h2 id="decision-problem">Decision Problem<a href="#decision-problem"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let me begin this post with a puzzle.
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    Alex and Bob work as financial advisers for the same company.
    They receive equal salaries from the company.  They behave well at
    office.  Both work on similar assignments.  Each assignment
    required a yes-no decision.  The company uses the decisions made
    by them to make profits.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the recession hit the company very badly, they have to fire
    one of them.  Both Alex and Bob have worked on almost the same
    number of assignments in the last ten years.  Alex has been
    consistently taking about 80% decisions correctly every year.
    Bob, on the other hand, has been taking only about 5% correct
    decisions every year.
  </p>
  <p>
    The company decides to keep Bob and fire Alex.  Why?
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  <em>This is a good time to pause and think about the puzzle.  There
  are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>
<h2 id="capacity-of-binary-symmetric-channel">Capacity of Binary Symmetric Channel<a href="#capacity-of-binary-symmetric-channel"></a></h2>
<p>
  We will come back to the puzzle.  Let us discuss the capacity of a
  binary symmetric channel for a while.
</p>
<p>
  The capacity of a binary symmetric channel with probability of error
  \( p \) is

  \[
    1 + p \log_2 p + (1 - p) \log_2 (1 - p).
  \]

  The probability of error \( p \) is the probability that the channel
  will corrupt a bit from 1 to 0 and vice versa.  The channel capacity
  is a measure of the amount of information that is possible to
  transmit over a channel.
</p>
<figure class="soft">
  <img src="files/blog/channel-capacity.png" alt="Graph">
  <figcaption>
    Graph of channel capacity vs probability of error
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  If \( p = 0, \) the channel capacity is maximum.  Roughly speaking,
  if the channel almost never corrupts a bit being transmitted, then
  the entire channel capacity can be used for data transmission.
</p>
<p>
  If \( p = \frac{1}{2}, \) the channel capacity is zero.  In this
  case, each bit received on the receiver's end is completely random.
  The channel is equally likely to send 0 or 1 irrespective of the
  original bit sent by the transmitter.
</p>
<p>
  What might be surprising is that as the probability of error
  increases from \( \frac{1}{2} \) to \( 1, \) the channel capacity
  increases.  When \( p = 1, \) the channel capacity is maximum again.
  It is easy to understand this intuitively.  At \( p = 1, \) the
  channel almost surely corrupts every bit.  Therefore the receiver
  can almost surely correct the error by inverting each bit in the
  received message.
</p>
<h2 id="solution-to-decision-problem">Solution to Decision Problem<a href="#solution-to-decision-problem"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us get back to the puzzle now.
</p>
<p>
  The company decides to keep Bob because he is more useful to the
  company.  He helps the company to take 95% correct decisions.  The
  company simply does the opposite of what Bob recommends and makes
  huge profits.  Alex on the other hand helps them take only 80%
  decisions correctly, so he has to go.  It is unfair but it is more
  profitable.
