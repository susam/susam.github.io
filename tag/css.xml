  How many CSS selectors and declarations do we need to produce the
  Fizz Buzz sequence?  Of course we could do this with no CSS at all
  simply by placing the entire sequence as text in the HTML body.  So
  to make the problem precise as well as to keep it interesting, we
  require that all text that appears in the Fizz Buzz sequence comes
  directly from the CSS.  Placing any part of the output numbers or
  words outside the stylesheet is not allowed.  JavaScript is not
  allowed either.  With these constraints, I think we need at least
  four CSS selectors along with four declarations to solve this
  puzzle, as shown below:
</p>
<pre>
<code>li { counter-increment: n }
li:not(:nth-child(5n))::before { content: counter(n) }
li:nth-child(3n)::before { content: "Fizz" }
li:nth-child(5n)::after { content: "Buzz" }</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a complete working example:
  <a href="css-fizz-buzz.html">css-fizz-buzz.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The above solution contains four CSS rules with one selector and one
  declaration in each rule.  For example,
  <code>li { counter-increment: n }</code> is one rule consisting of
  the selector <code>li</code> and the declaration
  <code>counter-increment: n</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Seasoned code golfers looking for a challenge can probably shrink
  this solution further.  A common trick to solve this problem is to
  use an ordered list (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) which provides the
  integers in the form of list markers automatically, thereby
  eliminating the need to maintain a counter in the stylesheet.
  However, this violates the requirement set out in the introduction.
  We want every integer to be produced directly by the stylesheet.
  Treating the integers in the list markers as part of the output
  sequence breaks this rule.  Not to mention the output looks untidy
  because of the unnecessary dot after each marker and also because
  the numbers and words appear misaligned.  See an example of that
  trick here:
  <a href="code/web/css-fizz-buzz-ol.html">css-fizz-buzz-ol.html</a>.
  Correcting the misaligned output calls for extra code that cancels
  out the number of declarations saved.  In any case, the requirement
  that all integers of the output must come directly from the
  stylesheet prevents untidy solutions like this and also forces us to
  rely on the capabilities of CSS to solve this puzzle.
</p>
<p>
  The intention here was to obtain the smallest possible code in terms
  of the number of CSS declarations.  This example is not crafted to
  minimise bytes, but for code golfers who enjoy reducing byte count,
  here is the number of bytes this solution consumes after removing
  all whitespace:
</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -sS https://susam.net/css-fizz-buzz.html | sed -n '/counter/,/after/p' | tr -d '[:space:]' | wc -c
152</code></pre>
<p>
  Further reduction in byte count can be achieved by using the
  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element instead of <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>,
  nesting CSS selectors, etc.  I'll leave that as an exercise for the
  reader.  Returning to the focus of this post as well as to summarise
  it, the solution here uses four CSS rules consisting of four
  selectors and four declarations to render the Fizz Buzz sequence.
