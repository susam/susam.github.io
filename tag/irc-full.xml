<![CDATA[
<p>
  During discussions with my friends and colleagues, whenever the
  topic of chat protocols comes up, I often remark how simple the
  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol is and how this simplicity has
  fostered creativity in the lives of many young computer hobbyists
  growing up in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  For many of us who
  were introduced to the Internet during that time, writing an IRC bot
  turned out to be one of our first few non-trivial hobby programming
  projects that involved network sockets, did something meaningful and
  served actual users.
</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity<a href="#simplicity"></a></h2>
<p>
  The underlying payloads that IRC servers and clients exchange during
  an IRC session are quite simple to read manually and understand.
  While implementing IRC servers still involves significant work to
  keep track of users and channels as well as exchanging network state
  and messages between servers, implementing IRC clients can often be
  quite simple.  With a convenient programming language, one can
  develop all kinds of fun tools and bots pretty quickly.  Only
  creativity is the limit!
</p>
<p>
  In the early days of IRC, it was quite common for someone with basic
  programming skills to write a simple IRC bot within a matter of
  hours.  Such IRC bots typically responded to requests from users,
  answered frequently asked questions, hosted trivia quiz, etc.  The
  simplicity of the protocol made it very enticing to write programs
  that could talk to IRC servers directly.  In fact, many people chose
  to write the code to parse and create IRC payloads from scratch.
  Observing the TCP/IP packets with a packet analyser such as
  Wireshark or Tcpdump was all one needed to learn about the various
  payload formats.  Additionally, back then
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1459">RFC 1459</a> served
  as a good reference to learn the IRC specification.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of the simplicity of the IRC protocol, sometimes when I
  wanted to join an IRC channel, say to seek some technical help, from
  a system without an IRC client installed, I would often just start
  a <code>telnet</code>, <code>nc</code> or <code>openssl</code>
  connection directly to my favourite IRC network and type out IRC
  protocol commands by hand to join channels and talk to users.
</p>
<h2 id="session">Session<a href="#session"></a></h2>
<p>
  To illustrate how simple the IRC protocol is, here is an example of
  a minimal IRC session that involves joining a channel and posting a
  message:
</p>

<p>
  In the above session, the user connects to the Libera Chat network
  with the nickname <code>humpty</code>, joins a channel
  named <code>#test</code> and posts a message.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the above session is not encrypted.  By convention, IRC
  port 6667 is used for cleartext connections.  A separate port, such
  as port 6697, is available for encrypted connections.  Here is an
  example of an encrypted IRC session established with the OpenSSL
  command line tool:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>openssl s_client -quiet -connect irc.libera.chat:6697 2&gt; /dev/null</kbd>
:strontium.libera.chat NOTICE * :*** Checking Ident
:strontium.libera.chat NOTICE * :*** Looking up your hostname...
:strontium.libera.chat NOTICE * :*** Couldn't look up your hostname

USER humpty humpty irc.libera.chat :Humpty Dumpty
:strontium.libera.chat 001 humpty :Welcome to the Libera.Chat Internet Relay Chat Network humpty
...</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The ellipsis denotes lines omitted for the sake of brevity.  The
  remainder of the session is quite similar to the first example in
  this post.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth noting here that although the payload format of IRC
  protocol is quite simple, as one starts writing IRC clients, one
  would stumble upon several tiny details about the protocol that
  needs to be taken care of, e.g. authenticating to the network,
  responding to <code>PING</code> messages from the server to avoid
  ping timeouts, splitting messages into shorter messages so that the
  overall payload does not exceed the message length limit of 512
  characters, etc.  For a serious IRC client, relying on a suitable
  library that already solves these problems and implements the IRC
  specification accurately is of course going to be useful.  But for a
  hobbyist who wants to understand the protocol and write some tools
  for fun, the textual nature of the IRC protocol and its simplicity
  offers a fertile ground for experimentation and creativity.

<p>
  In case you have never used IRC but this post has piqued your
  interest and you want to try it out, you probably don't want to be
  typing out IRC payloads by hand.  You would want a good IRC client
  instead.  Let me share some convenient ways to connect to the Libera
  Chat network.  Say, you want to join the <code>#python</code>
  channel on Libera Chat network.  Here are some ways to do it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join via web interface:
      <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#python">web.libera.chat/#python</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join using Irssi: On macOS, run <code>brew install irssi</code>
      to install it.  On Debian, Ubuntu or a Debian-based Linux
      system, run <code>sudo apt-get install irssi</code>.  Then
      enter <code>irssi -c irc.libera.chat</code> to connect to Libera
      Chat.  Then within Irssi, type <code>/join #python</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are numerous other ways to join IRC networks.  There are GUI
  desktop clients, web browser plugins, Emacs plugins, web-based
  services, bouncers, etc. that let users connect to IRC networks in
  various ways.  On Libera Chat, there are various channels for open
  source projects (<code>#emacs</code>, <code>#linux</code>, etc.),
  communities around specific subjects (<code>##math</code>,
  <code>#physics</code>, etc.), programming languages
  (<code>#c</code>, <code>#c++</code>, <code>#commonlisp</code>,
  etc.).  Type the <code>/join</code> command followed by a space and
  the channel name to join a channel and start posting and reading
  messages there.  It is also possible to search for channels by
  channel names.  For example, on Libera Chat, to search for all
  channels with 'python' in its name, enter the IRC
  command: <code>/msg alis list python</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Although I have used Libera Chat in the examples above, there are
  plenty of other IRC networks too such as EFNet, DALNet, OFTC, etc.
  Libera Chat happens to be one of the very popular and active
  networks for open source projects and topic based communities.  I
  use it everyday, so I chose it for the examples here.  There are
  many tight-knit communities on Libera Chat.  Some of my favourite
  ones are <code>#commonlisp</code>, <code>#emacs</code>,
  <code>#python</code>, etc.  All of these have very nice and active
  communities with great attitudes towards beginners.

<title>Algorithms Channel Migrates to Libera Chat</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Our <code>##algorithms</code> that has been running on the Freenode
  IRC network for the last 14 years is now migrating to the Libera
  Chat IRC network.  Our new channel name on Libera Chat
  is <code>#algorithms</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="history">History<a href="#history"></a></h2>
<p>
  The original <code>##algorithms</code> channel on Freenode IRC began
  as an offshoot of the <code>##math</code> channel there when we
  found that there was enough interest in the latter to form a channel
  dedicated to the subject of algorithms and data structures.  I
  created the new channel for algorithms in 2007.  I used to go by the
  nick <code>spal</code> and used to be active on both channels.
</p>
<p>
  What began as a tiny hobby group around algorithms gradually grew to
  be be a thriving community with over 200 members.  I don't
  participate in the channel much anymore but a highly talented group
  of moderators helps maintain the channel.
</p>

<h2 id="migration">Migration<a href="#migration"></a></h2>
<p>
  The original Freenode staff that used to run the Freenode network
  has stepped down after a controversial change in management of
  Freenode.  The former Freenode staff has now launched a new IRC
  network named <em>Libera Chat</em>.  Thousands of channels that used
  to exist on Freenode IRC earlier have been rapidly migrating to
  Libera Chat now.  For more on the events that led to this mass
  migration, see this
  post: <a href="https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409">The
  Freenode Resignation FAQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>##algorithms</code> channel too has now moved from
  Freenode to Libera Chat.  Our new channel name
  is <code>#algorithms</code> on Libera Chat.  Our entire operator team
  for the channel is also moving to the new channel.  The old channel
  on Freenode should now be considered defunct.
</p>

<h2 id="old-channel-information">Old Channel Information<a href="#old-channel-information"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here is the last known good state of the <code>##algorithms</code>
  channel on Freenode before we declared the channel defunct.

<h2 id="join">Join<a href="#join"></a></h2>
<p>
  If you are new to the world of IRC, here are some steps to join the
  Libera Chat network:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Install Irssi, an IRC chat client.  On macOS, enter the following
      command if you have Homebrew:
    </p>
    <pre><code>brew install irssi</code></pre>
    <p>
      On Debian, Ubuntu or another Debian-based Linux system, enter
      the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt-get install irssi</code></pre>
    <p>
      For other systems or environments,
      see <a href="https://irssi.org/">irssi.org</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the following command to connect to Libera Chat:
    </p>
    <pre><code>irssi -c irc.libera.chat</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now type these IRC commands into Irssi to join some channels:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>/join #algorithms
/join #irssi
/join #libera
/join #linux</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter this IRC command into Irssi to send me a message if you
      need any help:
    </p>
    <pre><code>/msg susam hello</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  You can also join the algorithms channel via Libera Chat's web
  interface
  at <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#algorithms">web.libera.chat</a>.
  This can be useful for those who want to join the network quickly
  without installing a client.  Further there is a Matrix bridge to the
  channel accessible
  via <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#algorithms:libera.chat">#algorithms:libera.chat</a>.
  The Matrix bridge is quite convenient for someone unfamiliar with
  IRC.  For example, you can close your browser or client and your chat
  session will still stay alive on the Matrix bridge.  You can connect
  back the next day and catch up with the messages.  Doing that with
  IRC requires setting up an IRC bouncers which may feel like
  considerable additional work.

<p>
  <strong>Update on 15 Jun 2021:</strong> All old communities on the
  Freenode IRC network are now gone.  The new Freenode staff has wiped
  out their database thereby resetting the state of their network.  We
  learnt about this when we received these global notices in our
  clients connected to the Freenode IRC network:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>-root- [Global Notice 1/3] We are moving past legacy freenode to a new
       fork.  The new freenode is launched.  You will slowly be
       disconnected and when you reconnect, you will be on the new
       freenode.  We patiently await to welcome you in freedom's
       holdout - the freenode.

-root- [Global Notice 2/3] If you're looking to connect now, you can
       already /server chat.freenode.net 6697 (ssl) or 6667
       (plaintext).  It's a new genesis for a new era.  Thank you for
       using freenode, and Hello World, from the future.  freenode is
       IRC.  freenode is FOSS.  freenode is freedom.

-root- [Global Notice 3/3] When you connect, register your nickname
       and your channel and get started.  It's a new world.  We're so
       happy to welcome you and the millions of others.  We will be
       posting more information in the coming days on our website and
       twitter.  Otherwise, see you on the other side!</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  See this thread on Reddit for a discussion on this
  event:
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/irc/comments/o01tmv">reddit.com/r/irc/comments/o01tmv</a>.
</p>
<p>
  What this really means is that decades old nicks and channels are
  completely wiped out!  For example, my own 15 year old nick is now
  gone.  Our algorithms channel on the Freenode network is also gone.
  All the nicks and other channels I was familiar with are also gone.
  I am not going to bother registering my nick and our channel there
  again!  It is not worth it.  We have all moved on to Libera Chat
  already and there is nothing left on Freenode to care about it
  anymore.

<samp>&lt;oops&gt; I have a confusion.  the calculation that was giving

&lt;oops&gt; 4 equally probable symbols: so 4 * (1/4) * log(1 / 1/4), right?
&lt;antonfire&gt; yeah math changes sometimes.
&lt;antonfire&gt; probably a math storm
&lt;antonfire&gt; wait a few minutes and try again
&lt;_Ray_&gt; try logging out and back in
&lt;oops&gt; so, so 1 * log(4) = 2
&lt;oops&gt; oh it is giving me 2 bits again
&lt;mariano|syzygy&gt; hmmm, actually he was not his advisor
&lt;oops&gt; thanks, nvm.
&lt;sig^&gt; try switching math off and on again
