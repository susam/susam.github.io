  In this note I elaborate the proof of a claim regarding Cayley
  graphs of symmetric groups with transpositions as generators that I
  found in the book <em>Algebraic Graph Theory</em> by Chris Godsil
  and Gordon Royle.  This claim appears as commentary in Section 3.10
  about <em>Transpositions</em>.  Here I present it in the form of a
  theorem along with a complete proof.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Theorem.</strong>
  <em>
    If \( \mathcal{T} \) is a set of transpositions, then the Cayley
    graph \( X(\operatorname{Sym}(n), \mathcal{T}) \) has no triangles.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  Suppose the vertices \( a, b, c \in
  \operatorname{Sym}(n) \) form a triangle in the Cayley graph \(
  X(\operatorname{Sym}(n), \mathcal{T}).  \)  Since multiplication by
  \( a^{-1} \) is an automorphism of the Cayley graph (by the proof of
  Theorem 3.1.2 that comes earlier), the vertices \( e, ba^{-1},
  ca^{-1} \) form a triangle too.  Let us label them as \( e, b', c'
  \) respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Now by the definition of a Cayley graph, for any two vertices \( a,
  b \in \operatorname{Sym}(n), \) we have

  \begin{align*}
    a \sim b
    &amp; \iff ba^{-1} \in \mathcal{T} \\
    &amp; \iff ba^{-1} = g \\
    &amp; \iff b = ga
  \end{align*}

  for some \( g \in \mathcal{T}.  \)  Therefore

  \begin{align*}
    e \sim b'  &amp; \iff b' = ge = g, \\
    e \sim c'  &amp; \iff c' = he = h, \\
    b' \sim c' &amp; \iff c' = lb'
  \end{align*}

  for some \( g, h, l \in \mathcal{T}.  \)  Note that the last equality gives

  \[
    l =c'b'^{-1} = hg^{-1} = hg \in \mathcal{T}
  \]

  Therefore \( g, h, hg \in \mathcal{T}.  \)  However, this is
  impossible since the product of two transpositions is \( e, \) a \(
  3 \)-cycle or a product of two disjoint transpositions.  For
  example, \( (12)(12) = e, \) \( (12)(13) = (123) \) and \( (12)(24)
  = (12)(24).  \)  Therefore \( hg \) cannot be a transposition,
  i.e. \( hg \notin \mathcal{T}.  \)  This is a contradiction.
  Therefore the vertices \( a, b, c \) cannot form a triangle.  We
  conclude that the Cayley graph \( X(\operatorname{Sym}(n),
  \mathcal{T}) \) has no triangles.

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Fizz Buzz is a counting game that has become oddly popular in the
  world of computer programming as a simple test of basic programming
  skills.  The rules of the game are straightforward.  Players say the
  numbers aloud in order beginning with one.  Whenever a number is
  divisible by 3, they say 'Fizz' instead.  If it is divisible by 5,
  they say 'Buzz'.  If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, the player
  says both 'Fizz' and 'Buzz'.  Here is a typical Python program that
  prints this sequence:
</p>
<pre><code>for n in range(1, 101):
    if n % 15 == 0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
    elif n % 3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
    elif n % 5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
    else:
        print(n)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is the output:
  <a href="files/blog/fizz-buzz.txt">fizz-buzz.txt</a>.  Can we make
  the program more complicated?  The words 'Fizz', 'Buzz' and
  'FizzBuzz' repeat in a periodic manner throughout the sequence.
  What else is periodic?  Trigonometric functions!  Perhaps we can use
  trigonometric functions to encode all four rules of the sequence in
  a single closed-form expression.  That is what we are going to
  explore in this article, for fun and no profit.
</p>
<p>
  By the end, we will obtain a discrete Fourier series that can take
  any integer \( n \) and select the corresponding text to be printed.
  In fact, we will derive it using two different methods.  First, we
  will follow a long-winded but hopefully enjoyable approach that
  relies on a basic understanding of complex exponentiation, geometric
  series and trigonometric functions.  Then, we will obtain the same
  result through a direct application of the discrete Fourier
  transform.

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions<a href="#definitions"></a></h2>
<p>
  Before going any further, we establish a precise mathematical
  definition for the Fizz Buzz sequence.  We begin by introducing a
  few functions that will help us define the Fizz Buzz sequence later.
</p>
<h3 id="symbol-functions">Symbol Functions<a href="#symbol-functions"></a></h3>
<p>
  We define a set of four functions \( \{ s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3 \} \) for
  integers \( n \) by:

  \begin{align*}
    s_0(n) &amp;= n, \\
    s_1(n) &amp;= \mathtt{Fizz}, \\
    s_2(n) &amp;= \mathtt{Buzz}, \\
    s_3(n) &amp;= \mathtt{FizzBuzz}.
  \end{align*}

  We call these the symbol functions because they produce every term
  that appears in the Fizz Buzz sequence.  The symbol function \( s_0
  \) returns \( n \) itself.  The functions \( s_1, \) \( s_2 \) and
  \( s_3 \) are constant functions that always return the literal
  words \( \mathtt{Fizz}, \) \( \mathtt{Buzz} \) and \(
  \mathtt{FizzBuzz} \) respectively, no matter what the value of \( n
  \) is.
</p>
<h3 id="index-function">Index Function<a href="#index-function"></a></h3>
<p>
  We define a function \( f(n) \) for integer \( n \) by

  \[
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if } 3 \mid n \text{ and } 5 \nmid n, \\
      2 &amp; \text{if } 3 \nmid n \text{ and } 5 \mid n, \\
      3 &amp; \text{if } 3 \mid n \text{ and } 5 \mid n, \\
      0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  The notation \( m \mid n \) means that the integer \( m \) divides
  the integer \( n, \) i.e. \( n \) is a multiple of \( m.  \)
  Equivalently, there exists an integer \( c \) such that \( n = cm
 .  \)  Similarly, \( m \nmid n \) means that \( m \) does not divide
  \( n, \) i.e. \( n \) is not a multiple of \( m.  \)
</p>
<p>
  This function covers all four conditions involved in choosing the \(
  n \)th item of the Fizz Buzz sequence.  As we will soon see, this
  function tells us which of the four symbol functions produces the \(
  n \)th item of the Fizz Buzz sequence.  For this reason, we call \(
  f(n) \) the index function.
</p>
<h3 id="fizz-buzz-sequence">Fizz Buzz Sequence<a href="#fizz-buzz-sequence"></a></h3>
<p>
  We now define the Fizz Buzz sequence as the sequence

  \[
    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty}
  \]

  We can expand the first few terms of the sequence explicitly as
  follows:

  \begin{align*}
    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty}
    &amp;= (s_{f(1)}(1), \; s_{f(2)}(2), \; s_{f(3)}(3), \; s_{f(4)}(4), \;
            s_{f(5)}(5), \; s_{f(6)}(6), \; s_{f(7)}(7), \; \dots) \\
    &amp;= (s_0(1), \; s_0(2), \; s_1(3), \; s_0(4),
            s_2(5), \; s_1(6), \; s_0(7), \; \dots) \\
    &amp;= (1, \; 2, \; \mathtt{Fizz}, \; 4, \;
            \mathtt{Buzz}, \; \mathtt{Fizz}, \; 7, \; \dots).
  \end{align*}

  Note how the function \( f(n) \) produces an index \( i \) which we
  then use to select the symbol function \( s_i(n) \) to produce the
  \( n \)th term of the sequence.  This is precisely why we decided to
  call \( f(n) \) the index function while defining it in the previous
  section.
</p>
<h2 id="from-indicator-functions-to-cosines">From Indicator Functions to Cosines<a href="#from-indicator-functions-to-cosines"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here we discuss the first method of deriving our closed form
  expression, starting with indicator functions and rewriting them
  using complex exponentials and cosines.
</p>
<h3 id="indicator-functions">Indicator Functions<a href="#indicator-functions"></a></h3>
<p>
  Here is the index function \( f(n) \) from the previous section with
  its cases and conditions rearranged to make it easier to spot
  interesting patterns:

  \[
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
      0 &amp; \text{if } 5 \nmid n \text{ and } 3 \nmid n, \\
      1 &amp; \text{if } 5 \nmid n \text{ and } 3 \mid n, \\
      2 &amp; \text{if } 5 \mid n \text{ and } 3 \nmid n, \\
      3 &amp; \text{if } 5 \mid n \text{ and } 3 \mid n.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  This function helps us select another function \( s_{f(n)}(n) \)
  which in turn determines the \( n \)th term of the Fizz Buzz
  sequence.  Our goal now is to replace this piecewise formula with a
  single closed-form expression.  To do so, we first define indicator
  functions \( I_m(n) \) as follows:

  \[
    I_m(n) = \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\
      0 &amp; \text{if } m \nmid n.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  The formula for \( f(n) \) can now be written as:

  \[
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
      0 &amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 0 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 0, \\
      1 &amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 0 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 1, \\
      2 &amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 1 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 0, \\
      3 &amp; \text{if } I_5(n) = 1 \text{ and } I_3(n) = 1.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  Do you see a pattern?  Here is the same function written as a table:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th>\( I_5(n) \)</th>
    <th>\( I_3(n) \)</th>
    <th>\( f(n) \)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
    <td>\( 0 \)</td>
    <td>\( 2 \)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
    <td>\( 1 \)</td>
    <td>\( 3 \)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Do you see it now?  If we treat the values in the first two columns
  as binary digits and the values in the third column as decimal
  numbers, then in each row the first two columns give the binary
  representation of the number in the third column.  For example, \(
  3_{10} = 11_2 \) and indeed in the last row of the table, we see the
  bits \( 1 \) and \( 1 \) in the first two columns and the number \(
  3 \) in the last column.  In other words, writing the binary digits
  \( I_5(n) \) and \( I_3(n) \) side by side gives us the binary
  representation of \( f(n).  \)  Therefore

  \[
    f(n) = 2 \, I_5(n) + I_3(n).
  \]

  We can now write a small program to demonstrate this formula:
</p>
<pre>
<code>for n in range(1, 101):
    s = [n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz']
    i = (n % 3 == 0) + 2 * (n % 5 == 0)
    print(s[i])</code>
</pre>
<p>
  We can make it even shorter at the cost of some clarity:
</p>
<pre>
<code>for n in range(1, 101):
    print([n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz'][(n % 3 == 0) + 2 * (n % 5 == 0)])</code>
</pre>
<p>
  What we have obtained so far is pretty good.  While there is no
  universal definition of a closed-form expression, I think most
  people would agree that the indicator functions as defined above are
  simple enough to be permitted in a closed-form expression.
</p>
<h3 id="complex-exponentials">Complex Exponentials<a href="#complex-exponentials"></a></h3>
<p>
  In the previous section, we obtained the formula

  \[
    f(n) = I_3(n) + 2 \, I_5(n)
  \]

  which we then used as an index to look up the text to be printed.
  We also argued that this is a pretty good closed-form expression
  already.
</p>
<p>
  However, in the interest of making things more complicated, we must
  ask ourselves: What if we are not allowed to use the indicator
  functions?  What if we must adhere to the commonly accepted meaning
  of a closed-form expression which allows only finite combinations of
  basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
  division, integer exponents and roots with integer index as well as
  functions such as exponentials, logarithms and trigonometric
  functions.  It turns out that the above formula can be rewritten
  using only addition, multiplication, division and the cosine
  function.  Let us begin the translation.  Consider the sum

  \[
    S_m(n) = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{i 2 \pi k n / m},
  \]

  where \( i \) is the imaginary unit and \( n \) and \( m \) are
  integers.  This is a geometric series in the complex plane with
  ratio \( r = e^{i 2 \pi n / m}.  \)  If \( n \) is a multiple of \( m
 , \) then \( n = cm \) for some integer \( c \) and we get

  \[
    r
    = e^{i 2 \pi n / m}
    = e^{i 2 \pi c}
    = 1.
  \]

  Therefore, when \( n \) is a multiple of \( m, \) we get

  \[
    S_m(n)
    = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{i 2 \pi k n / m}
    = \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} 1^k
    = m.
  \]

  If \( n \) is not a multiple of \( m, \) then \( r \ne 1 \) and the
  geometric series becomes

  \[
    S_m(n)
    = \frac{r^m - 1}{r - 1}
    = \frac{e^{i 2 \pi n} - 1}{e^{i 2 \pi n / m} - 1}
    = 0.
  \]

  Therefore,

  \[
    S_m(n) = \begin{cases}
      m &amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\
      0 &amp; \text{if } m \nmid n.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  Dividing both sides by \( m, \) we get

  \[
    \frac{S_m(n)}{m} = \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if } m \mid n, \\
      0 &amp; \text{if } m \nmid n.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  But the right-hand side is \( I_m(n).  \)  Therefore

  \[
    I_m(n)
    = \frac{S_m(n)}{m}
    = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{k = 0}^{m - 1} e^{i 2 \pi k n / m}.
  \]
</p>
<h3 id="cosines">Cosines<a href="#cosines"></a></h3>
<p>
  We begin with Euler's formula

  \[
    e^{i x} = \cos x + i \sin x
  \]

  where \( x \) is a real number.  From this formula, we get

  \[
    e^{i x} + e^{-i x} = 2 \cos x.
  \]

  Therefore

  \begin{align*}
    I_3(n)
    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \sum_{k = 0}^2 e^{i 2 \pi k n / 3} \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \left( 1 + e^{i 2 \pi n / 3} +
                                  e^{i 4 \pi n / 3} \right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \left( 1 + e^{i 2 \pi n / 3} +
                                  e^{-i 2 \pi n / 3} \right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right).
  \end{align*}

  The third equality above follows from the fact that \( e^{i 4 \pi n
  / 3} = e^{i 6 \pi n / 3} e^{-i 2 \pi n / 3} = e^{i 2 \pi n} e^{-i 2
  \pi n/3} = e^{-i 2 \pi n / 3} \) when \( n \) is an integer.
</p>
<p>
  The function above is defined for integer values of \( n \) but we
  can extend its formula to real \( x \) and plot it to observe its
  shape between integers.  As expected, the function takes the value
  \( 1 \) whenever \( x \) is an integer multiple of \( 3 \) and \( 0
  \) whenever \( x \) is an integer not divisible by \( 3.  \)
</p>
<figure class="soft">

  <figcaption>
    Graph of \( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi x}{3} \right) \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Similarly,

  \begin{align*}
    I_5(n)
    &amp;= \frac{1}{5} \sum_{k = 0}^4 e^{i 2 \pi k n / 5} \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{5} \left( 1 + e^{i 2 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{i 4 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{i 6 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{i 8 \pi n / 5} \right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{5} \left( 1 + e^{i 2 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{i 4 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{-i 4 \pi n / 5}
                                + e^{-i 2 \pi n / 5} \right) \\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right)
                       + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right).
  \end{align*}

  Extending this expression to real values of \( x \) allows us to
  plot its shape as well.  Once again, the function takes the value \(
  1 \) at integer multiples of \( 5 \) and \( 0 \) at integers not
  divisible by \( 5.  \)
</p>
<figure class="soft">
  <img src="files/blog/fizz-buzz-i5.png" alt="Graph">

      \frac{1}{5}
      + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi x}{5} \right)
      + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi x}{5} \right)
    \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Recall that we expressed \( f(n) \) as

  \[
    f(n) = I_3(n) + 2 \, I_5(n).
  \]

  Substituting these trigonometric expressions yields

  \[
    f(n)
    = \frac{1}{3}
      + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right)
      + 2 \cdot \left(
        \frac{1}{5}
        + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right)
        + \frac{2}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right)
      \right).
  \]

  A straightforward simplification gives

  \[
    f(n)
    = \frac{11}{15}
      + \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right)
      + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right)
      + \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right).
  \]

  We can extend this expression to real \( x \) and plot it as well.
  The resulting curve takes the values \( 0, 1, 2 \) and \( 3 \) at
  integer points, as desired.

  Now we can write our Python program as follows:
</p>
<pre>
<code>from math import cos, pi
for n in range(1, 101):

<h2 id="dft">Discrete Fourier Transform<a href="#dft"></a></h2>
<p>
  The keen-eyed might notice that the expression we obtained for \(
  f(n) \) is a discrete Fourier series.  This is not surprising, since
  the output of a Fizz Buzz program depends only on \( n \bmod 15.  \)
  Any function on a finite cyclic group can be written exactly as a
  finite Fourier expansion.  In this section, we obtain \( f(n) \)
  using the discrete Fourier transform.  It is worth mentioning that
  the calculations presented here are quite tedious to do by hand.
  Nevertheless, this section offers a glimpse of how such calculations
  are performed.  By the end, we will arrive at exactly the same \(
  f(n) \) as before.  There is nothing new to discover here.  We
  simply obtain the same result by a more direct but more laborious
  method.  If this doesn't sound interesting, you may safely skip the
  subsections that follow.

<h3 id="one-period-of-fizz-buzz">One Period of Fizz Buzz<a href="#one-period-of-fizz-buzz"></a></h3>
<div style="display: none">\( \gdef\arraystretch{1.2} \)</div>
<p>
  We know that \( f(n) \) is a periodic function with period \( 15.  \)
  To apply the discrete Fourier transform, we look at one complete
  period of the function using the values \( n = 0, 1, \dots, 14.  \)
  Over this period, we have:

  \begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccccc}
      n &amp;  0 &amp;  1 &amp;  2 &amp;  3 &amp;  4
        &amp;  5 &amp;  6 &amp;  7 &amp;  8 &amp;  9
        &amp; 10 &amp; 11 &amp; 12 &amp; 13 &amp; 14 \\
    \hline
    f(n) &amp; 3 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  1 &amp;  0
         &amp; 2 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  1
         &amp; 2 &amp;  0 &amp;  1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0
  \end{array}

  The discrete Fourier series of \( f(n) \) is

  \[
    f(n) = \sum_{k = 0}^{14} c_k \, e^{i 2 \pi k n / 15}
  \]

  where the Fourier coefficients \( c_k \) are given by the discrete
  Fourier transform

  \[
    c_k = \frac{1}{15} \sum_{n = 0}^{14} f(n) e^{-i 2 \pi k n / 15}.
  \]

  for \( k = 0, 1, \dots, 14.  \)  The formula for \( c_k \) is called
  the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).  The formula for \( f(n) \) is
  called the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT).
</p>
<h3 id="fourier-coefficients">Fourier Coefficients<a href="#fourier-coefficients"></a></h3>
<p>
  Let \( \omega = e^{-i 2 \pi / 15}.  \)  Then using the values of \(
  f(n) \) from the table above, the DFT becomes:

  \[
    c_k = \frac{3 + \omega^{3k} + 2 \omega^{5k} + \omega^{6k}
                  + \omega^{9k} + 2 \omega^{10k} + \omega^{12k}}{15}.
  \]

  Substituting \( k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 14 \) into the above equation
  gives us the following Fourier coefficients:

  \begin{align*}
    c_{0}  &amp;= \frac{11}{15}, \\
    c_{3}  &amp;= c_{6} = c_{9} = c_{12} = \frac{2}{5}, \\
    c_{5}  &amp;= c_{10} = \frac{1}{3}, \\
    c_{1}  &amp;= c_{2} = c_{4} = c_{7} = c_{8} = c_{11} = c_{13} = c_{14} = 0.
  \end{align*}

  Calculating these Fourier coefficients by hand can be rather
  tedious.  In practice they are almost always calculated using
  numerical software, computer algebra systems or even simple code
  such as the example here:
  <a href="code/fizz-buzz-fourier/fizz-buzz-fourier.py">fizz-buzz-fourier.py</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="inverse-transform">Inverse Transform<a href="#inverse-transform"></a></h3>
<p>
  Once the coefficients are known, we can substitute them into the
  inverse transform introduced earlier to obtain

  \begin{align*}
    f(n)
    &amp;= \sum_{k = 0}^{14} c_k \, e^{i 2 \pi k n / 15} \\[1.5em]
    &amp;= \frac{11}{15}
           + \frac{2}{5} \left(
             e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 3n / 15}
             + e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 6n / 15}
             + e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 9n / 15}
             + e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 12n / 15}
           \right) \\
           &amp; \phantom{=\frac{11}{15}}
           + \frac{1}{3} \left(
             e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 5n / 15}
             + e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 10n / 15}
           \right) \\[1em]
    &amp;= \frac{11}{15}
           + \frac{2}{5} \left(
             e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 3n / 15}
             + e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 6n / 15}
             + e^{-i 2 \pi \cdot 6n / 15}
             + e^{-i 2 \pi \cdot 3n / 15}
           \right) \\
           &amp; \phantom{=\frac{11}{15}}
           + \frac{1}{3} \left(
             e^{i 2 \pi \cdot 5n / 15}
             + e^{-i 2 \pi \cdot 5n / 15}
           \right) \\[1em]
    &amp;= \frac{11}{15}
       + \frac{2}{5} \left(
         2 \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right)
         + 2 \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right)
       \right) \\
       &amp; \phantom{=\frac{11}{15}}
       + \frac{1}{3} \left(
         2 \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right)
       \right) \\[1em]
    &amp;= \frac{11}{15} +
       \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right) +
       \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right) +
       \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right).
  \end{align*}

  This is exactly the same expression for \( f(n) \) we obtained in
  the previous section.  We see that the Fizz Buzz index function \(
  f(n) \) can be expressed precisely using the machinery of Fourier
  analysis.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  To summarise, we have defined the Fizz Buzz sequence as

  \[
    (s_{f(n)}(n))_{n = 1}^{\infty}
  \]

  where

  \[
    f(n)
    = \frac{11}{15} +
      \frac{2}{3} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{3} \right) +
      \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n}{5} \right) +
      \frac{4}{5} \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{5} \right).
  \]

  and \( s_0(n) = n, \) \( s_1(n) = \mathtt{Fizz}, \) \( s_2(n) =
  \mathtt{Buzz} \) and \( s_3(n) = \mathtt{FizzBuzz}.  \)  A Python
  program to print the Fizz Buzz sequence based on this definition was
  presented earlier.  That program can be written more succinctly as
  follows:
</p>
<pre>
<code>from math import cos, pi
for n in range(1, 101):
    print([n, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz'][round(11 / 15 + (2 / 3) * cos(2 * pi * n / 3) + (4 / 5) * (cos(2 * pi * n / 5) + cos(4 * pi * n / 5)))])</code>
</pre>
<p>
  We can also wrap this up nicely in a shell one-liner, in case you
  want to share it with your friends and family and surprise them:
</p>
<pre><code>python3 -c 'from math import cos, pi; [print([n, "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz"][round(11/15 + (2/3) * cos(2*pi*n/3) + (4/5) * (cos(2*pi*n/5) + cos(4*pi*n/5)))]) for n in range(1, 101)]'</code></pre>
<p>
  We have taken a simple counting game and turned it into a
  trigonometric construction consisting of a discrete Fourier series
  with three cosine terms and four coefficients.  None of this makes
  Fizz Buzz any easier.  Quite the contrary.  But it does show that
  every \( \mathtt{Fizz} \) and \( \mathtt{Buzz} \) now owes its
  existence to a particular set of Fourier coefficients.  We began
  with the modest goal of making this simple problem more complicated.
  I think it is safe to say that we did not fall short.

<!-- Lisp and other things -->
<p class="question" id="lisp-and-other-things">
  Hi <a href="https://lobste.rs/~susam">@susam</a>, I primarily know
  you as a Lisper, what other things do you use?
</p>
<p>
  Yes, I use Lisp extensively for my personal projects and much of
  what I do in my leisure is built on it.  I ran
  a <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">mathematics pastebin</a>
  for close to thirteen years.  It was quite popular on some IRC
  channels.  The pastebin was written in Common Lisp.
  My <a href="https://susam.net/">personal website</a> and blog are
  generated using a tiny static site generator written in Common Lisp.
  Over the years I have built several other personal tools in it as
  well.
</p>
<p>
  I am an active Emacs Lisp programmer too.  Many of my software tools
  are in fact Emacs Lisp functions that I invoke with convenient key
  sequences.  They help me automate repetitive tasks as well as
  improve my text editing and task management experience.
</p>
<p>
  I use plenty of other tools as well.  In my early adulthood, I spent
  many years working with C, C++, Java and PHP.  My
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">first
  substantial open source contribution</a> was to the Apache Nutch
  project which was in Java and one of my early original open source
  projects was <a href="https://github.com/susam/uncap">Uncap</a>, a C
  program to remap keys on Windows.
</p>
<p>
  These days I use a lot of Python, along with some Go and Rust, but
  Lisp remains important to my personal work.  I also enjoy writing
  small standalone tools directly in HTML and JavaScript, often with
  all the code in a single file in a readable, unminified form.
</p>
<!-- Lisp, Emacs and mathematics -->
<p class="question" id="lisp-emacs-and-mathematics">
  How did you first discover computing, then end up with Lisp, Emacs
  and mathematics?
</p>
<p>
  I got introduced to computers through the Logo programming language
  as a kid.  Using simple arithmetic, geometry, logic and code to
  manipulate a two-dimensional world had a lasting effect on me.
</p>
<p>
  I still vividly remember how I ended up with Lisp.  It was at an
  airport during a long layover in 2007.  I wanted to use the time to
  learn something, so I booted my laptop
  running <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> GNU/Linux 4.0
  (Etch) and then started
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/">GNU CLISP</a> 2.41.
  In those days, Wi-Fi in airports was uncommon.  Smartphones and
  mobile data were also uncommon.  So it was fortunate that I had
  CLISP already installed on my system and my laptop was ready for
  learning Common Lisp.  I had it installed because I had wanted to
  learn Common Lisp for some time.  I was especially attracted by its
  simplicity, by the fact that the entire language can be built up
  from a very small set of special forms.  I
  use <a href="https://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a> these days, by the way.
</p>
<p>
  I discovered Emacs through Common Lisp.  Several sources recommended
  using the <a href="https://slime.common-lisp.dev/">Superior Lisp
  Interaction Mode for Emacs (SLIME)</a> for Common Lisp programming,
  so that's where I began.  For many years I continued to use Vim as
  my primary editor, while relying on Emacs and SLIME for Lisp
  development.  Over time, as I learnt more about Emacs itself, I grew
  fond of Emacs Lisp and eventually made Emacs my primary editor and
  computing environment.
</p>
<p>
  I have loved mathematics since my childhood days.  What has always
  fascinated me is how we can prove deep and complex facts using first
  principles and clear logical steps.  That feeling of certainty and
  rigour is unlike anything else.
</p>
<p>
  Over the years, my love for the subject has been rekindled many
  times.  As a specific example, let me share how I got into number
  theory.  One day I decided to learn the RSA cryptosystem.  As I was
  working through the
  <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf">RSA
  paper</a>, I stumbled upon the Euler totient function
  \( \varphi(n) \) which gives the number of positive integers not
  exceeding n that are relatively prime to n.  The paper first states
  that

  \[
    \varphi(p) = p - 1
  \]

  for prime numbers \( p.  \)  That was obvious since \( p \) has no
  factors other than \( 1 \) and itself, so every integer from \( 1 \)
  up to \( p - 1 \) must be relatively prime to it.  But then it
  presents

  \[
    \varphi(pq) = \varphi(p) \cdot \varphi(q) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
  \]

  for primes \( p \) and \( q.  \)  That was not immediately obvious to
  me back then.  After a few minutes of thinking, I managed to prove
  it from scratch.  By the inclusion-exclusion principle, we count how
  many integers from \( 1 \) up to \( pq \) are not divisible by
  \(p \) or \( q.  \)  There are \( pq \) integers in total.  Among
  them, there are \( q \) integers divisible by \( p \) and \( p \)
  integers divisible by \( q.  \)  So we need to subtract \( p + q \)
  from \(pq.  \)  But since one integer (\( pq \) itself) is counted in
  both groups, we add \( 1 \) back.  Therefore

  \[
    \varphi(pq) = pq - (p + q) + 1 = (p - 1)(q - 1).
  \]

  Next I could also obtain the general formula for \( \varphi(n) \)
  for an arbitrary positive integer \( n \) using the same idea.
  There are several other proofs too, but that is how I derived the
  general formula for \( \varphi(n) \) when I first encountered it.
  And just like that, I had begun to learn number theory!
</p>
<!-- Computing for fun -->
<p class="question" id="computing-for-fun">
  You've said you prefer computing for fun.  What is fun to you?  Do
  you have an idea of what makes something fun or not?
</p>
<p>
  For me, fun in computing began when I first learnt IBM/LCSI PC Logo
  when I was nine years old.  I had very limited access to computers
  back then, perhaps only about two hours per <em>month</em> in the
  computer laboratory at my primary school.  Most of my Logo
  programming happened with pen and paper at home.  I would "test" my
  programs by tracing the results on graph paper.  Eventually I would
  get about thirty minutes of actual computer time in the lab to run
  them for real.
</p>
<p>
  So back then, most of my computing happened without an actual
  computer.  But even with that limited access to computers, a whole
  new world opened up for me: one that showed me the joy of computing
  and more importantly, the joy of sharing my little programs with my
  friends and teachers.  One particular Logo program I still remember
  very well drew a house with animated dashed lines, where the dashes
  moved around the outline of the house.  Everyone around me loved it,
  copied it and tweaked it to change the colours, alter the details
  and add their own little touches.
</p>
<p>
  For me, fun in computing comes from such exploration and sharing.  I
  enjoy asking "what happens if" and then seeing where it leads me.
  My Emacs package
  <a href="https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/devil.html">devil-mode</a>
  comes from such exploration.  It came from asking, "What happens if
  we avoid using the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>meta</kbd> modifier keys
  and use <kbd>,</kbd> (the comma key) or another suitable key as a
  leader key instead?  And can we still have a non-modal editing
  experience?"
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes computing for fun may mean crafting a minimal esoteric
  drawing language, making a small game or building a tool that solves
  an interesting problem elegantly.  It is a bonus if the exploration
  results in something working well enough that I can share with
  others on the World Wide Web and others find it fun too.
</p>
<!-- Pursuits -->
<p class="question" id="interests-and-exploration">
  How do you choose what to investigate?  Which most interest you,
  with what commonalities?
</p>
<p>
  For me, it has always been one exploration leading to another.
</p>
<p>
  For example, I originally built
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">MathB</a> for my friends
  and myself who were going through a phase in our lives when we used
  to challenge each other with mathematical puzzles.  This tool became
  a nice way to share solutions with each other.  Its use spread from
  my friends to their friends and colleagues, then to schools and
  universities and eventually to IRC channels.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, I built <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a>
  when I was learning neural networks and taking a lot of notes on the
  subject.  I was not ready to share the notes online, but I did want
  to share them with my friends and colleagues who were also learning
  the same topic.  Normally I would write my notes in LaTeX, compile
  them to PDF and share the PDF, but in this case, I wondered, what if
  I took some of the code from MathB and created a tool that would let
  me write plain Markdown
  (<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GFM</a>) + LaTeX
  (<a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>) in
  a <code>.html</code> file and have the tool render the file as soon
  as it was opened in a web browser?  That resulted in TeXMe, which
  has surprisingly become one of my most popular projects, receiving
  millions of hits in some months according to the CDN statistics.
</p>
<p>
  Another example is <a href="https://susam.github.io/muboard/">Muboard</a>,
  which is a bit like an interactive mathematics chalkboard.  I built
  this when I was hosting an
  <a href="journey-to-prime-number-theorem.html">analytic number
  theory book club</a> and I needed a way to type LaTeX snippets live
  on screen and see them immediately rendered.  That made me wonder:
  what if I took TeXMe, made it interactive and gave it a chalkboard
  look-and-feel?  That led to Muboard.
</p>
<p>
  So we can see that sharing mathematical notes and snippets has been
  a recurring theme in several of my projects.  But that is only a
  small fraction of my interests.  I have a wide variety of interests
  in computing.  I also engage in random explorations, like writing
  IRC clients
  (<a href="https://github.com/susam/nimb">NIMB</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/tzero">Tzero</a>),
  ray tracing
  (<a href="https://github.com/susam/pov25">POV-Ray</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/spxy/java-ray-tracing">Java ray tracer</a>),
  writing Emacs guides
  (<a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/emfy">Emfy</a>),
  developing small single-file HTML games
  (<a href="invaders.html">Andromeda Invaders</a>,
  <a href="myrgb.html">Guess My RGB</a>),
  purely recreational programming
  (<a href="fxyt.html">FXYT</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/may4">may4.fs</a>,
  <a href="self-printing-machine-code.html">self-printing machine code</a>,
  <a href="primegrid.html">prime number grid explorer</a>)
  and so on.  The list goes on.  When it comes to hobby computing, I
  don't think I can pick just one domain and say it interests me the
  most.  I have a lot of interests.
</p>
<!-- What is computing?  -->
<p class="question" id="computing-activities">
  What is computing, to you?
</p>
<p>
  Computing, to me, covers a wide range of activities: programming a
  computer, using a computer, understanding how it works, even
  building one.  For example, I once built a tiny 16-bit CPU along
  with a small main memory that could hold only eight 16-bit
  instructions, using VHDL and a Xilinx CPLD kit.  The design was
  based on the Mano CPU introduced in the book <em>Computer System
  Architecture</em> (3rd ed.) by M. Morris Mano.  It was incredibly
  fun to enter instructions into the main memory, one at a time, by
  pushing DIP switches up and down and then watch the CPU I had built
  execute an entire program.  For someone like me, who usually works
  with software at higher levels of abstraction, that was a thrilling
  experience!
</p>
<p>
  Beyond such experiments, computing also includes more practical and
  concrete activities, such as installing and using my favourite Linux
  distribution (Debian), writing software tools in languages like
  Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, Python and the shell command language or
  customising my Emacs environment to automate repetitive tasks.
</p>
<p>
  To me, computing also includes the abstract stuff like spending time
  with abstract algebra and number theory and getting a deeper
  understanding of the results pertaining to groups, rings and fields,
  as well as numerous number-theoretic results.  Browsing the
  <a href="https://oeis.org/">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer
  Sequences</a> (OEIS), writing small programs to explore interesting
  sequences or just thinking about them is computing too.  I think
  many of the interesting results in computer science have deep
  mathematical foundations.  I believe much of computer science is
  really discrete mathematics in action.
</p>
<p>
  And if we dive all the way down from the CPU to the level of
  transistors, we encounter continuous mathematics as well, with
  non-linear voltage-current relationships and analogue behaviour that
  make digital computing possible.  It is fascinating how, as a
  relatively new species on this planet, we have managed to take sand
  and find a way to use continuous voltages and currents in electronic
  circuits built with silicon and convert them into the discrete
  operations of digital logic.  We have machines that can simulate
  themselves!
</p>
<p>
  To me, all of this is fun.  To study and learn about these things,
  to think about them, to understand them better and to accomplish
  useful or amusing results with this knowledge is all part of the
  fun.
</p>
<!-- Programming vs domains -->
<p class="question" id="programming-vs-domains">
  How do you view programming vs. domains?
</p>
<p>
  I focus more on the domain than the tool.  Most of the time it is a
  problem that catches my attention and then I explore it to
  understand the domain and arrive at a solution.  The problem itself
  usually points me to one of the tools I already know.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if it is about working with text files, I might write
  an Emacs Lisp function.  If it involves checking large sets of
  numbers rapidly for patterns, I might choose C++ or Rust.  But if I
  want to share interactive visualisations of those patterns with
  others, I might rewrite the solution in HTML and JavaScript,
  possibly with the use of the Canvas API, so that I can share the
  work as a self-contained file that others can execute easily within
  their web browsers.  When I do that, I prefer to keep the HTML neat
  and readable, rather than bundled or minified, so that people who
  like to 'View Source' can copy, edit and customise the code
  themselves to immediately see their changes take effect.
</p>
<p>
  Let me share a specific example.  While working on a web-based game, I first
  used <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code>'s <code>fillText()</code>
  to display text on the game canvas.  However, dissatisfied with the
  text rendering quality, I began looking for IBM PC OEM fonts and
  similar retro fonts online.  After downloading a few font packs, I
  wrote a little Python script to convert them to bitmaps (arrays of
  integers) and then used the bitmaps to draw text on the canvas using
  JavaScript, one cell at a time, to get pixel-perfect results!  These
  tiny Python and JavaScript tools were good enough that I felt
  comfortable sharing them together as a tiny toolkit called
  <a href="https://susam.github.io/pcface/src/demo.html">PCFace</a>.
  This toolkit offers JavaScript bitmap arrays and tiny JavaScript
  rendering functions, so that someone else who wants to display text
  on their game canvas using PC fonts and nothing but plain HTML and
  JavaScript can do so without having to solve the problem from
  scratch!
</p>
<!-- Applicability of old functionality for new problems -->
<p class="question" id="old-functionality-and-new-problems">
  Has the rate of your making new Emacs functions has diminished over
  time (as if everything's covered) or do the widening domains lead to
  more?  I'm curious how applicable old functionality is for new
  problems and how that impacts the APIs!
</p>
<p>
  My rate of making new Emacs functions has definitely decreased.
  There are two reasons.  One is that over the years my computing
  environment has converged into a comfortable, stable setup I am very
  happy with.  The other is that at this stage of life I simply cannot
  afford the time to endlessly tinker with Emacs as I did in my
  younger days.
</p>
<p>
  More generally, when it comes to APIs, I find that well-designed
  functionality tends to remain useful even when new problems appear.
  In Emacs, for example, many of my older functions continue to serve
  me well because they were written in a composable way.  New problems
  can often be solved with small wrappers or combinations of existing
  functions.  I think APIs that consist of functions that are simple,
  orthogonal and flexible age well.  If each function in an API does
  one thing and does it well (the Unix philosophy), it will have
  long-lasting utility.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, new domains and problems do require new functions and
  extensions to an API, but I think it is very important to not give
  in to the temptation of enhancing the existing functions by making
  them more complicated with optional parameters, keyword arguments,
  nested branches and so on.  Personally, I have found that it is much
  better to implement new functions that are small, orthogonal and
  flexible, each doing one thing and doing it well.
</p>
<p class="question" id="designing-for-composability">
  What design methods or tips do you have, to increase composability?
</p>
<p>
  For me, good design starts with good vocabulary.  Clear vocabulary
  makes abstract notions concrete and gives collaborators a shared
  language to work with.  For example, while working on a network
  events database many years ago, we collected data minute by minute
  from network devices.  We decided to call each minute of data from a
  single device a "nugget".  So if we had 15 minutes of data from 10
  devices, that meant 150 nuggets.
</p>
<p>
  Why "nugget"?  Because it was shorter and more convenient than
  repeatedly saying "a minute of data from one device".  Why not
  something less fancy like "chunk"?  Because we reserved "chunk" for
  subdivisions within a nugget.  Perhaps there were better choices,
  but "nugget" was the term we settled on and it quickly became shared
  terminology between the collaborators.  Good terminology naturally
  carries over into code.  With this vocabulary in place, function
  names like <code>collect_nugget()</code>,
  <code>open_nugget()</code>, <code>parse_chunk()</code>,
  <code>index_chunk()</code>, <code>skip_chunk()</code>,
  etc. immediately become meaningful to everyone involved.
</p>
<p>
  Thinking about the vocabulary also ensures that we are thinking
  about the data, concepts and notions we are working with in a
  deliberate manner and that kind of thinking also helps when we
  design the architecture of software.
</p>
<p>
  Too often I see collaborators on software projects jump straight
  into writing functions that take some input and produce some desired
  effect, with variable names and function names decided on the fly.
  To me, this feels backwards.  I prefer the opposite approach.
  Define the terms first and let the code follow from them.
</p>
<p>
  I also prefer developing software in a layered manner, where complex
  functionality is built from simpler, well-named building blocks.  It
  is especially important to avoid <em>layer violations</em>, where
  one complex function invokes another complex function.  That creates
  tight coupling between two complex functions.  If one function
  changes in the future, we have to reason carefully about how it
  affects the other.  Since both are already complex, the cognitive
  burden is high.  A better approach, I think, is to identify the
  common functionality they share and factor that out into smaller,
  simpler functions.
</p>
<p>
  To summarise, I like to develop software with a clear vocabulary,
  consistent use of that vocabulary, a layered design where complex
  functions are built from simpler ones and by avoiding layer
  violations.  I am sure none of this is new to the Lobsters
  community.  Some of these ideas also occur
  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">domain-driven
  design</a> (DDD).  DDD defines the term <em>ubiquitous language</em>
  to mean, "A language structured around the domain model and used by
  all team members within a bounded context to connect all the
  activities of the team with the software."  If I could call this
  approach of software development something, I would simply call it
  "vocabulary-driven development" (VDD), though of course DDD is the
  more comprehensive concept.
</p>
<p>
  Like I said, none of this is likely new to the Lobsters community.
  In particular, I suspect Forth programmers would find it too
  obvious.  In Forth, it is very difficult to begin with a long,
  poorly thought-out monolithic word and then break it down into
  smaller ones later.  The stack effects quickly become too hard to
  track mentally with that approach.  The only viable way to develop
  software in Forth is to start with a small set of words that
  represent the important notions of the problem domain, test them
  immediately and then compose higher-level words from the lower-level
  ones.  Forth naturally encourages a layered style of development,
  where the programmer thinks carefully about the domain, invents
  vocabulary and expresses complex ideas in terms of simpler ones,
  almost in a mathematical fashion.  In my experience, this kind of
  deliberate design produces software that remains easy to understand
  and reason about even years after it was written.
</p>
<!-- Small vs large functions -->
<p class="question" id="small-vs-large-functions">
  Not enhancing existing functions but adding new small ones seems
  quite lovely, but how do you come back to such a codebase later with
  many tiny functions?  At points, I've advocated for very large
  functions, particularly traumatized by Java-esque 1000 functions in
  1000 files approaches.  When you had time, would you often
  rearchitecture the conceptual space of all of those functions?
</p>
<p>
  The famous quote from Alan J. Perlis comes to mind:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure
    than 10 functions on 10 data structures.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Personally, I enjoy working with a codebase that has thousands of
  functions, provided most of them are small, well-scoped and do one
  thing well.  That said, I am not dogmatically opposed to large
  functions.  It is always a matter of taste and judgement.  Sometimes
  one large, cohesive function is clearer than a pile of tiny ones.
</p>
<p>
  For example, when I worked on parser generators, I often found that
  lexers and finite state machines benefited from a single top-level
  function containing the full tokenisation logic or the full state
  transition logic in one place.  That function could call smaller
  helpers for specific tasks, but we still need the overall
  <code>switch</code>-<code>case</code> or
  <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> or <code>cond</code> ladder
  somewhere.  I think trying to split that ladder into smaller
  functions would only make the code harder to follow.
</p>
<p>
  So while I lean towards small, composable functions, the real goal
  is to strike a balance that keeps code maintainable in the long run.
  Each function should be as small as it can reasonably be and no
  smaller.
</p>
<!-- Domains -->
<p class="question" id="domains-and-projects">
  Like you, I program as a tool to explore domains.  Which do you know
  the most about?
</p>
<p>
  For me too, the appeal of computer programming lies especially in
  how it lets me explore different domains.  There are two kinds of
  domains in which I think I have gained good expertise.  The first
  comes from years of developing software for businesses, which has
  included solving problems such as network events parsing, indexing
  and querying, packet decoding, developing parser generators,
  database session management and TLS certificate lifecycle
  management.  The second comes from areas I pursue purely out of
  curiosity or for hobby computing.  This is the kind I am going to
  focus on in our conversation.
</p>
<p>
  Although computing and software are serious business today, for me,
  as for many others, computing is also a hobby.
</p>
<p>
  Personal hobby projects often lead me down various rabbit holes and
  I end up learning new domains along the way.  For example, although
  I am not a web developer, I learnt to build small, interactive
  single-page tools in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript simply because I
  needed them for my hobby projects over and over again.  An early
  example is <a href="quickqwerty.html">QuickQWERTY</a>, which I built
  to teach myself and my friends touch-typing on QWERTY keyboards.
  Another example is <a href="cfrs.html">CFRS[]</a>, which I created
  because I wanted to make a total (non-Turing complete) drawing
  language that has turtle graphics like Logo but is absolutely
  minimal like P&prime;&prime;.
</p>
<!-- Double spacing -->
<p class="question" id="double-spacing-and-touch-typing">
  You use double spaces after periods which I'd only experienced from
  people who learned touch typing on typewriters, unexpected!
</p>
<p>
  Yes, I do separate sentences by double spaces.  It is interesting
  that you noticed this.
</p>
<p>
  I once briefly learnt touch typing on typewriters as a kid, but
  those lessons did not stick with me.  It was much later, when I used
  a Java applet-based touch typing tutor that I found online about two
  decades ago, that the lessons really stayed with me.  Surprisingly,
  that application taught me to type with a single space between
  sentences.  By the way, I disliked installing Java plugins into the
  web browser, so I wrote <a href="quickqwerty.html">QuickQWERTY</a>
  as a similar touch typing tutor in plain HTML and JavaScript for
  myself and my friends.
</p>
<p>
  I learnt to use double spaces between sentences first with Vim and
  then later again with Emacs.  For example, in Vim,
  the <code>joinspaces</code> option is on by default, so when we join
  sentences with the normal mode command <code>J</code> or format
  paragraphs with <code>gqap</code>, Vim inserts two spaces after full
  stops.  We need to disable that behaviour with <code>:set
  nojoinspaces</code> if we want single spacing.
</p>
<p>
  It is similar in Emacs.  In Emacs, the
  <code>delete-indentation</code> command (<code>M-^</code>) and
  the <code>fill-paragraph</code> command (<code>M-q</code>) both
  insert two spaces between sentences by default.  Single spacing can
  be enabled with <code>(setq sentence-end-double-space nil)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Incidentally, I spend a good portion of the README for my Emacs
  quick-start DIY kit named
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/emfy">Emfy</a> discussing sentence
  spacing conventions under the section
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/emfy#single-space-for-sentence-spacing">Single
  Space for Sentence Spacing</a>.  There I explain how to configure
  Emacs to use single spaces, although I use double spaces myself.
  That's because many new Emacs users prefer single spacing.
</p>
<p>
  The defaults in Vim and Emacs made me adopt double spacing.  The
  double spacing convention is also widespread across open source
  software.  If we look at the Vim help pages, Emacs built-in
  documentation or the Unix and Linux man pages, double spacing is the
  norm.  Even inline comments in traditional open source projects
  often use it.  For example, see Vim's
  <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/v9.1.1752/runtime/doc/usr_01.txt">:h usr_01.txt</a>,
  Emacs's
  <a href="https://cgit.git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/doc/emacs/emacs.texi?h=emacs-30.2#n1556">(info "(emacs) Intro")</a>
  or the comments in the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;f=gcc/cfg.cc;hb=releases/gcc-15.2.0">GCC source code</a>.
</p>
<!-- Learning -->
<p class="question" id="approach-to-learning">
  How do you approach learning a new domain?
</p>
<p>
  When I take on a new domain, there is of course a lot of reading
  involved from articles, books and documentation.  But as I read, I
  constantly try to test what I learn.  Whenever I see a claim, I ask
  myself, "If this claim were wrong, how could I demonstrate it?"
  Then I design a little experiment, perhaps write a snippet of code
  or run a command or work through a concrete example, with the goal
  of checking the claim in practice.
</p>
<p>
  Now I am not genuinely hoping to prove a claim wrong.  It is just a
  way to engage with the material.  To illustrate, let me share an
  extremely simple and generic example without going into any
  particular domain.  Suppose I learn that Boolean operations in
  Python short-circuit.  I might write out several experimental
  snippets like the following:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def t(): print('t'); return True
def f(): print('f'); return False
f() or t() or f()
</code></pre>
<p>
  And then confirm that the results do indeed confirm short-circuit
  evaluation (<code>f</code> followed by <code>t</code> in this case).
</p>
<p>
  At this point, one could say, "Well, you just confirmed what the
  documentation already told you."  And that's true.  But for me, the
  value lies in trying to test it for myself.  Even if the claim
  holds, the act of checking forces me to see the idea in action.
  That not only reinforces the concept but also helps me build a much
  deeper intuition for it.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes these experiments also expose gaps in my own
  understanding.  Suppose I didn't properly know what "short-circuit"
  means.  Then the results might contradict my expectations.  That
  contradiction would push me to correct my misconception and that's
  where the real learning happens.
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally, this process even uncovers subtleties I didn't expect.
  For example, while learning socket programming, I discovered that a
  client can successfully receive data using <code>recv()</code> even
  after calling <code>shutdown()</code>, contrary to what I had first
  inferred from the specifications.  See my Stack Overflow post
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/39698037/303363">Why can recv()
  receive messages after the client has invoked shutdown()?</a> for
  more details if you are curious.
</p>
<p>
  Now this method cannot always be applied, especially if it is very
  expensive or unwieldy to do so.  For example, if I am learning
  something in the finance domain, it is not always possible to
  perform an actual transaction.  One can sometimes use simulation
  software, mock environments or sandbox systems to explore ideas
  safely.  Still, it is worth noting that this method has its
  limitations.
</p>
<p>
  In mathematics, though, I find this method highly effective.  When I
  study a new branch of mathematics, I try to come up with examples
  and counterexamples to test what I am learning.  Often, failing to
  find a counterexample helps me appreciate more deeply why a claim
  holds and why no counterexamples exist.
</p>
<!-- Distraction -->
<p class="question" id="managing-time-and-distractions">
  Do you have trouble not getting distracted with so much on your
  plate?  I'm curious how you balance the time commitments of
  everything!
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, it is very easy to get distracted.  One thing that has
  helped over the years is the increase in responsibilities in other
  areas of my life.  These days I also spend some of my free time
  studying mathematics textbooks.  With growing responsibilities and
  the time I devote to mathematics, I now get at most a few hours each
  week for hobby computing.  This automatically narrows down my
  options.  I can explore perhaps one or at most two ideas in a month
  and that constraint makes me very deliberate about choosing my
  pursuits.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the explorations do not evolve into something solid that I
  can share.  They remain as little experimental code snippets or
  notes archived in a private repository.  But once in a while, an
  exploration grows into something concrete and feels worth sharing on
  the Web.  That becomes a short-term hobby project.  I might work on
  it over a weekend if it is small or for a few weeks if it is more
  complex.  When that happens, the goal of sharing the project helps
  me focus.
</p>
<p>
  I try not to worry too much about making time.  After all, this is
  just a hobby.  Other areas of my life have higher priority.  I also
  want to devote a good portion of my free time to learning more
  mathematics, which is another hobby I am passionate about.  Whatever
  little spare time remains after attending to the higher-priority
  aspects of my life goes into my computing projects, usually a couple
  of hours a week, most of it on weekends.
</p>
<!-- Blogging -->
<p class="question" id="blogging">
  How does blogging mix in?  What's the development like of a single
  piece of curiosity through wrestling with the domain, learning and
  sharing it etc.?
</p>
<p>
  Maintaining my personal website is another aspect of computing that
  I find very enjoyable.  My website began as a loose collection of
  pages on a LAN site during my university days.  Since then I have
  been adding pages to it to write about various topics that I find
  interesting.  It acquired its blog shape and form much later when
  blogging became fashionable.
</p>
<p>
  I usually write a new blog post when I feel like there is some piece
  of knowledge or some exploration that I want to archive in a
  persistent format.  Now what the development of a post looks like
  depends very much on the post.  So let me share two opposite
  examples to describe what the development of a single piece looks
  like.
</p>
<p>
  One of my most frequently visited posts
  is <a href="lisp-in-vim.html">Lisp in Vim</a>.  It started when I
  was hosting a Common Lisp programming club for beginners.  Although
  I have always used Emacs and SLIME for Common Lisp programming
  myself, many in the club used Vim, so I decided to write a short
  guide on setting up something SLIME-like there.  As a former
  long-time Vim user myself, I wanted to make the Lisp journey easier
  for Vim users too.  I thought it would be a 30-minute exercise where
  I write up a README that explains how to install
  <a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv">Slimv</a> and how to set
  it up in Vim.  But then I discovered a newer plugin called
  <a href="https://github.com/vlime/vlime">Vlime</a> that also offered
  SLIME-like features in Vim!  That detail sent me down a very deep
  rabbit hole.  Now I needed to know how the two packages were
  different, what their strengths and weaknesses were, how routine
  operations were performed in both and so on.  What was meant to be a
  short note turned into a nearly 10,000-word article.  As I was
  comparing the two SLIME-like packages for Vim, I also found a few
  bugs in Slimv and contributed fixes for them
  (<a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv/pull/87">#87</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv/pull/88">#88</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv/pull/89">#89</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv/pull/90">#90</a>).
  Writing this blog post turned into a month-long project!
</p>
<p>
  At the opposite extreme is a post like
  <a href="elliptical-python-programming.html">Elliptical
  Python Programming</a>.  I stumbled upon Python's
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis">Ellipsis</a>
  while reviewing someone's code.  It immediately caught my attention.
  I wondered if, combined with some standard obfuscation techniques,
  one could write arbitrary Python programs that looked almost like
  Morse code.  A few minutes of experimentation showed that a
  genuinely Morse code-like appearance was not possible, but something
  close could be achieved.  So I wrote what I hope is a humorous post
  demonstrating that arbitrary Python programs can be written using a
  very restricted set of symbols, one of which is the ellipsis.  It
  took me less than an hour to write this post.  The final result
  doesn't look quite like Morse code as I had imagined, but it is
  quite amusing nevertheless!
</p>
<!-- Forums -->
<p class="question" id="forums">
  What draws you to post and read online forums?  How do you balance
  or allot time for reading technical articles, blogs etc.?
</p>
<p>
  The exchange of ideas!  Just as I enjoy sharing my own
  computing-related thoughts, ideas and projects, I also find joy in
  reading what others have to share.
</p>
<p>
  Other areas of my life take precedence over hobby projects and hobby
  projects take precedence over technical forums.

  After I've given time to the higher-priority parts of my life and to

<!-- MathB.in -->
<p class="question" id="mathb-moderation-problems">
  When you decided to stop with MathB due to moderation burdens, I
  offered to take over/help and you mentioned others had too.  Did
  anyone end up forking it, to your knowledge?
</p>
<p>
  I first thought of shutting down the
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">MathB</a>-based pastebin
  website in November 2019.  The website had been running for seven
  years at that time.  When I announced my thoughts to the IRC
  communities that would be affected, I received a lot of support and
  encouragement.  A few members even volunteered to help me out with
  moderation.  That support and encouragement kept me going for
  another six years.  However, the volunteers eventually became busy
  with their own lives and moved on.  After all, moderating user
  content for an open pastebin that anyone in the world can post to is
  a thankless and tiring activity.  So most of the moderation activity
  fell back on me.  Finally, in February 2025, I realised that I no
  longer want to spend time on this kind of work.
</p>
<p>
  I developed MathB with a lot of passion for myself and my friends.
  I had no idea at the time that this little project would keep a
  corner of my mind occupied even during weekends and holidays.  There
  was always a nagging worry.  What if someone posted content that
  triggered compliance concerns and my server was taken offline while
  I was away?  I no longer wanted that kind of burden in my life.  So
  I finally decided to shut it down.  I've written more about this
  in <a href="mathbin-is-shutting-down.html">MathB.in Is Shutting
  Down</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To my knowledge, no one has forked it, but others have developed
  alternatives.  Further, the

  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mathb.in/">archived</a>
  all posts from the now-defunct MathB-based website.  A member of the

  about a week to get everything successfully archived.

<!-- Textbooks -->
<p class="question" id="favourite-mathematics-textbooks">
  What're your favorite math textbooks?
</p>
<p>
  I have several favourite mathematics books, but let me share three I
  remember especially fondly.
</p>
<p>
  The first is <em>Advanced Engineering Mathematics</em> by Erwin
  Kreyszig.  I don't often see this book recommended online, but for
  me it played a major role in broadening my horizons.  I think I
  studied the 8th edition back in the early 2000s.  It is a hefty book
  with over a thousand pages and I remember reading it cover to cover,
  solving every exercise problem along the way.  It gave me a solid
  foundation in routine areas like differential equations, linear
  algebra, vector calculus and complex analysis.  It also introduced
  me to Fourier transforms and Laplace transforms, which I found
  fascinating.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, the Fourier transform has a wide range of applications in
  signal processing, communications, spectroscopy and more.  But I
  want to focus on the fun and playful part.  In the early 2000s, I
  was also learning to play the piano as a hobby.  I used to record my
  amateur music compositions with
  <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity">Audacity</a> by
  connecting my digital piano to my laptop with a line-in cable.  It
  was great fun to plot the spectrum of my music on Audacity, apply
  high-pass and low-pass filters and observe how the Fourier transform
  of the audio changed and then hear the effect on the music.  That
  kind of hands-on tinkering made Fourier analysis intuitive for me
  and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys both music and
  mathematics.
</p>
<p>
  The second book is <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>
  by Tom M.  Apostol.  As a child I was intrigued by the prime number
  theorem but lacked the mathematical maturity to understand its
  proof.  Years later, as an adult, I finally taught myself the proof
  from Apostol's book.  It was a fantastic journey that began with
  simple concepts like the Möbius function and Dirichlet products and
  ended with quite clever contour integrals that proved the theorem.
  The complex analysis I had learnt from Kreyszig turned out to be
  crucial for understanding those integrals.  Along the way I gained a
  deeper understanding of the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s).  \)
  The book discusses zero-free regions where \( \zeta(s) \) does not
  vanish, which I found especially fascinating.  Results like \(
  \zeta(-1) = -1/12, \) which once seemed mysterious, became obvious
  after studying this book.
</p>
<p>
  The third is <em>Galois Theory</em> by Ian Stewart.  It introduced
  me to field extensions, field homomorphisms and solubility by
  radicals.  I had long known that not all quintic equations are
  soluble by radicals, but I didn't know why.  Stewart's book taught
  me exactly why.  In particular, it demonstrated that the polynomial
  \( t^5 - 6t + 3 \) over the field of rational numbers is not soluble
  by radicals.  This particular result, although fascinating, is just
  a small part of a much larger body of work, which is even more
  remarkable.  To arrive at this result, the book takes us through a
  wonderful journey that includes the theory of polynomial rings,
  algebraic and transcendental field extensions, impossibility proofs
  for ruler-and-compass constructions, the Galois correspondence and
  much more.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most rewarding aspects of reading books like these is how
  they open doors to new knowledge, including things I didn't even
  know that I didn't know.
</p>
<!-- Mathematics and computing -->
<p class="question" id="mathematics-and-computing">
  How does the newer math jell with or inform past or present
  computing, compared to much older stuff?
</p>
<p>
  I don't always think explicitly about how mathematics informs
  computing, past or present.  Often the textbooks I pick feel very
  challenging to me, so much so that all my energy goes into simply
  mastering the material.  It is arduous but enjoyable.  I do it
  purely for the fun of learning without worrying about applications.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, a good portion of pure mathematics probably has no
  real-world applications.  As G. H. Hardy famously wrote in <em>A
  Mathematician's Apology</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I have never done anything 'useful'.  No discovery of mine has
    made or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or
    ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  But there is no denying that some of it does find applications.
  Were Hardy alive today, he might be disappointed that number theory,
  his favourite field of "useless" mathematics, is now a crucial part
  of modern cryptography.  Electronic commerce wouldn't likely exist
  without it.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, it is amusing how something as abstract as abstract
  algebra finds very concrete applications in coding theory.  Concepts
  such as polynomial rings, finite fields and cosets of subspaces in
  vector spaces over finite fields play a crucial role in
  error-correcting codes, without which modern data transmission and
  storage would not be possible.
</p>
<p>
  On a more personal note, some simpler areas of mathematics have been
  directly useful in my own work.  While solving problems for
  businesses, information entropy, combinatorics and probability
  theory were crucial when I worked on gesture-based authentication
  about one and a half decades ago.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, when I was developing Bloom filter-based indexing and
  querying for a network events database, again, probability theory
  was crucial in determining the parameters of the Bloom filters (such
  as the number of hash functions, bits per filter and elements per
  filter) to ensure that the false positive rate remained below a
  certain threshold.  Subsequent testing with randomly sampled network
  events confirmed that the observed false positive rate matched the
  theoretical estimate quite well.  It was very satisfying to see
  probability theory and the real world agreeing so closely.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond these specific examples, studying mathematics also influences
  the way I think about problems.  Embarking on journeys like analytic
  number theory or Galois theory is humbling.  There are times when I
  struggle to understand a small paragraph of the book and it takes me
  several hours (or even days) to work out the arguments in detail
  with pen and paper (lots of it) before I really grok them.  That
  experience of grappling with dense reasoning teaches humility and
  also makes me sceptical of complex, hand-wavy logic in day-to-day
  programming.
</p>
<p>
  Several times I have seen code that bundles too many decisions into
  one block of logic, where it is not obvious whether it would behave
  correctly in all circumstances.  Explanations may sometimes be
  offered about why it works for reasonable inputs, but the reasoning
  is often not watertight.  The experience of working through
  mathematical proofs, writing my own, making mistakes and then
  correcting them has taught me that if the reasoning for correctness
  is not clear and rigorous, something could be wrong.  In my
  experience, once such code sees real-world usage, a bug is nearly
  always found.
</p>
<p>
  That's why I usually insist either on simplifying the logic or on
  demonstrating correctness in a clear, rigorous way.  Sometimes this
  means doing a case-by-case analysis for different types of inputs or
  conditions and showing that the code behaves correctly in each case.
  There is also a bit of an art to reducing what seem like numerous or
  even infinitely many cases to a small, manageable set of cases by
  spotting structure, such as symmetries, invariants or natural
  partitions of the input space.  Alternatively, one can look for a
  simpler argument that covers all cases.  These are techniques we
  employ routinely in mathematics and I think that kind of thinking
  and reasoning is quite valuable in software development too.

  A knight moves two squares in one direction, then one square
  perpendicular to it, forming an L-shaped path.  If a piece occupies
  the destination square, the knight captures it.  If two knights are
  placed such that each can capture the other in a single move, then
  we say the knights attack each other.  We want to determine the
  number of ways to place two identical knights on an \( n \times n \)
  chessboard so that they attack each other.

    All \( 8 \) ways two identical knights can attack each other on a
    \( 3 \times 3 \) board.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Let \( f(n) \) denote the number of ways we can place two identical
  knights on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that they attack each
  other, where \( n \ge 1.  \)
</p>
<p>
  A \( 1 \times 1 \) board has room for only one knight, so we define
  \( f(1) = 0.  \)  On a \( 2 \times 2 \) board, a knight cannot move
  two squares in any direction and therefore cannot attack.
  Therefore, \( f(2) = 0.  \)  To summarise,

  \[
    f(1) = f(2) = 0.
  \]

  From the illustration above, we see that \( f(3) = 8.  \)  We want to
  find a closed-form expression for \( f(n).  \)
</p>
<p>
  We will analyse this problem from various perspectives.  We begin
  with a couple of needlessly complicated approaches, followed by a
  simple and elegant solution.  While I personally enjoy these
  long-winded explorations, if you prefer a more direct solution,
  please skip ahead
  to <a href="#counting-placements-from-minimal-attack-sections">Counting
  Placements From Minimal Attack Sections</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Before we proceed, let us introduce the term <em>mutually attacking
  knight placement</em> to mean a placement of two knights on the
  chessboard such that they attack each other.  Unless stated
  otherwise, the two knights are identical.  This term will serve as a
  convenient shorthand for referring to such placements.
</p>
<h2 id="counting-placements-as-the-board-grows">Counting Placements as the Board Grows<a href="#counting-placements-as-the-board-grows"></a></h2>
<p>
  We now turn to the needlessly complicated solution promised in the
  previous section.  We analyse the <em>new</em> mutually attacking
  knight placements introduced when an existing board is enlarged by
  adding a row and a column.
</p>
<p>
  Let us define

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = f(n) - f(n - 1)
  \]

  for \( n \ge 2, \) so that \( \Delta f(n) \) denotes the new
  mutually attacking knight placements introduced when an \( (n - 1)
  \times (n - 1) \) board is expanded to size \( n \times n \) by
  adding one row and one column.
</p>
<p>
  For brevity, we will avoid restating the process of enlarging an \(
  (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) board to an \( n \times n \) board by
  adding one row and one column whenever we refer to new placements.
  Instead, we use the term <em>new placements</em> on an
  \( n \times n \) board to refer to \( \Delta f(n).  \)  It is to be
  understood that these new placements are the mutually attacking
  knight placements introduced by enlarging the board from size \( (n
  - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to \( n \times n.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Without loss of generality, suppose the new row and column are added
  to the bottom and right respectively.  We already know that

  \begin{align*}
    \Delta f(2) &amp; = f(2) - f(1) = 0 - 0 = 0, \\
    \Delta f(3) &amp; = f(3) - f(2) = 8 - 0 = 8.  \\
  \end{align*}

  We will now find \( \Delta f(n) \) for \( n \ge 4.  \)  To do this,
  we first categorise the newly added squares due to board expansion,
  into four types, as illustrated below.

    New squares, labelled by type, as the board size increases from \(

<p>
  Here is a brief description of each square type:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Type A squares are the three new corner squares.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type B squares are the two new squares adjacent to type A squares
    at the top and left edges.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type C squares are the new squares that are <em>not</em> adjacent
    to any type A square.  If the new board has dimensions \( n \times
    n, \) where \( n \ge 4, \) then there are exactly \( 2n - 8 \)
    squares of type C.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type D squares are the two new squares adjacent to the
    bottom-right type A square.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We now calculate how many new mutually attacking knight placements
  are introduced by these additional squares as the board expands.  We
  proceed with a case-by-case analysis for each square type.
</p>
<h3 id="type-a-squares">Type A Squares<a href="#type-a-squares"></a></h3>
<p>
  There are three squares of type A.  If we place one knight on a type
  A square, there are two positions for the second knight such that
  the two knights attack each other.

</p>
<h3 id="type-c-squares">Type C Squares<a href="#type-c-squares"></a></h3>
<p>
  The number of type C squares depends on the board size.  When we
  increase the size of a board from \( (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to
  \(n \times n, \) where \( n \ge 4, \) we add \( n^2 - (n - 1)^2 = 2n
  - 1 \) new squares.  Among these, \( 3 \) are of type A, \( 2 \) are
  of type B and \( 2 \) are of type D.  That gives us a total of \(

  If we add the number of new mutually attacking knight placements
  found in each of the cases above, we get

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = 6 + 6 + 8(n - 4) + 4 = 8(n - 2)
  \]

  new mutually attacking knight placements as the board size increases
  from \( (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to \( n \times n, \) where \( n
  \ge 4.  \)  We already know that \( \Delta f(2) = 0 \) and \( \Delta
  f(3) = 8.  \)  Surprisingly, the above formula produces the correct
  values for those cases as well.  Therefore, we can generalise this
  result as

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = 8(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 2.  \)  We can now calculate \( f(n) \) for \( n \ge
  1 \) as follows:

  \begin{align*}
    f(n)
    &amp; = \sum_{k = 1}^n f(k) - \sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} f(k) \\
    &amp; = \sum_{k = 1}^n f(k) - \sum_{k = 2}^n f(k - 1) \\
    &amp; = f(1) + \sum_{k = 2}^n (f(k) - f(k - 1)) \\
    &amp; = f(1) + \sum_{k = 2}^n \Delta f(k) \\
    &amp; = 0 + \sum_{k = 2}^n 8(k - 2) \\
    &amp; = 8 \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 2} k \\
    &amp; = \frac{8(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2} \\
    &amp; = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \end{align*}

  To summarise, we now have a closed form expression for \( f(n).  \)
  For all \( n \ge 1, \) we have

  \[
    f(n) = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).

  The previous section took a long-winded path to arrive at a closed
  form expression for \( f(n).  \)  In this section, we will reach the
  same result that is still a bit drawn out, but not quite as much as
  before.
</p>
<p>
  This time, instead of looking only at the new squares created when
  the board grows, we consider <em>every</em> square on the board.  To
  make the counting easier, we no longer treat the knights as
  identical.  We first work with two distinct knights, count the
  mutually attacking knight placements and then divide the total by \(
  2 \) to get the result for identical knights.
</p>
<h3 id="attacking-degrees-of-squares">Attacking Degrees of Squares<a href="#attacking-degrees-of-squares"></a></h3>
<p>
  Here, we introduce the term <em>attacking degree of a square</em> to
  mean the number of squares a knight can move to from that square in
  a single move.  In other words, the attacking degree of a square is
  the number of squares that would be attacked if a knight were placed
  on it.  For example, the corner squares have an attacking degree of
  \( 2.  \)

  With eight such squares, we get \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) mutually

  number of mutually attacking knight placements on a \( 3 \times 3 \)
  board when the two knights are identical.  This matches the earlier

<h3 id="from-attacking-degrees-to-counting-placements">From Attacking Degrees to Counting Placements<a href="#from-attacking-degrees-to-counting-placements"></a></h3>
<p>
  Let \( g(n) \) be the number of mutually attacking knight placements
  on an \( n \times n \) board when the knights are distinct.  Then \(
  g(n) \) is simply the sum of the attacking degrees of all squares on
  the board.  As before, let \( f(n) \) denote the number of mutually
  attacking knight placements on an \( n \times n \) board when the
  two knights are identical.  We will now show that
  \( f(n) = g(n)/2.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Label all squares of the \( n \times n \) board as \( S_1, S_2,
  \dots, S_{n^2} \) in any fixed order.  Label the two distinct
  knights as \( N_1 \) and \( N_2.  \)  We represent each mutually
  attacking knight placement as an ordered pair \( (S_i, S_j) \) if \(
  N_1 \) is on \( S_i \) and \( N_2 \) is on \( S_j, \) with the two
  knights attacking each other.  Here \( 1 \le i, j \le n^2 \) and \(
  i \ne j.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Let \( M \) be the set of all mutually attacking knight placements
  for distinct knights on an \( n \times n \) board.  Then

  \[
    g(n) = \lvert M \rvert.
  \]

  If \( (S_i, S_j) \) is a mutually attacking knight placement of the
  distinct knights \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) for some \( i \) and
  \( j \) with \( 1 \le i, j \le n^2 \) and \( i \ne j, \) then \(
  (S_j, S_i) \) is also a mutually attacking knight placement, since
  swapping the positions of the two mutually attacking knights still
  yields a valid mutually attacking placement.  Therefore

  \[
    (S_i, S_j) \in M \iff (S_j, S_i) \in M.
  \]

  Each ordered placement \( (S_i, S_j) \) in \( M \) is thus paired
  with the ordered placement \( (S_j, S_i).  \)  When the knights are
  identical, the two arrangements are indistinguishable and count as
  one placement.  Hence, the number of mutually attacking placements
  for identical knights is exactly half of the number for distinct
  knights, i.e.

  \[
    f(n) = \frac{g(n)}{2}.
  \]

  The next subsection focuses on calculating \( g(n), \) from which \(
  f(n) \) follows immediately by the above formula.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-2">Closed Form Expression<a href="#closed-form-expression-2"></a></h3>
<p>
  As noted in the previous section, the number of mutually attacking
  knight placements for two distinct knights on an \( n \times n \)
  board is simply the sum of attacking degrees of all squares on the
  board.  If we label each square as discussed in the previous section
  and use the notation \( \deg(S_i) \) for the attacking degree of the
  square labelled \( S_i, \) where \( 1 \le i \le n^2, \) then

  \[
    g(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n^2} \deg(S_i).
  \]

  Recall that the attacking degree of a square is the number of
  squares a knight could attack if it were placed there.  Earlier, we
  saw that on a \( 3 \times 3 \) board, all squares except the centre
  one have attacking degree \( 2, \) which gives \( g(3) = 8 \times 2
  = 16 \) and \( f(3) = g(3)/2 = 8.  \)  Let us now write down the
  attacking degrees of all squares on a \( 4 \times 4 \) board.

  <figcaption>
    Attacking degrees of all squares on a \( 6 \times 6 \) board
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  From this illustration, we get

  \begin{align*}
    g(6) &amp; = 4 \times 2 + 8 \times 3 + 12 \times 4 + 8 \times 6 + 4 \times 8 = 160.  \\
    f(6) &amp; = g(6)/2 = 80.
  \end{align*}

  Let us find a general formula now for \( n \ge 4.  \)  We introduce
  one more notation.  Let \( D_k(n) \) denote the sum of the attacking
  degrees of all squares of attacking degree \( k \) on an \( n \times
  n \) board, i.e.

  \[
    D_k(n) = \sum_{\mathclap{\deg(S_i) = k}} \deg(S_i).
  \]

  Since the only attacking degrees the squares can have are \( 2, 3,
  4, 6 \) and \( 8, \) the sum of the attacking degrees of all squares
  can be written as

  \[
    g(n) = D_2(n) + D_3(n) + D_4(n) + D_6(n) + D_8(n).
  \]

  There are exactly four squares of attacking degree \( 2.  \)  These
  are the corner ones.  Therefore,

  \[
    D_2(n) = 4 \times 2 = 8.
  \]

  The eight squares adjacent to the corner squares have attacking
  degree \( 3.  \)  Therefore,

  \[
    D_3(n) = 8 \times 3 = 24.
  \]

  Let us define an <em>inner corner square</em> as one that shares a
  corner with a corner square but not an edge with it.  There are four
  inner corner squares and each has attacking degree \( 4.  \)
  Further, each row and column on the outer edge contains \( n - 4 \)
  additional squares with attacking degree \( 4.  \)  Therefore,

  \[
    D_4(n) = (4 + 4(n - 4))(4) = 16(n - 3).
  \]

  Consider a row or column that contains two inner corner squares of
  attacking degree \( 4.  \)  All \( n - 4 \) squares between the inner
  corner squares have attacking degree \( 6.  \)  There are two such
  rows and two such columns.  Therefore,

  \[
    D_6(n) = 4(n - 4)(6) = 24(n - 4).
  \]

  We have counted the attacking degrees of all squares in the first
  two columns and rows as well as the last two columns and rows.  We
  are left with \( (n - 4)^2 \) squares in the middle and they all
  have attacking degree \( 8.  \)  Therefore,

  \[
    D_8(n) = 8(n - 4)^2.
  \]

  Therefore,

  \begin{align*}
    g(n)
    &amp; = D_2(n) + D_3(n) + D_4(n) + D_6(n) + D_8(n) \\
    &amp; = 8 + 24 + 16(n - 3) + 24(n - 4) + 8(n - 4)^2 \\
    &amp; = 8(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \end{align*}

  Even though we assumed \( n \ge 4 \) while obtaining the above
  formula, remarkably, it gives us the correct values for \( n = 1,
  2 \) and \( 3.  \)  The number of mutually attacking knight
  placements for distinct knights on an \( n \times n \) board is \(
  0 \) if \( n = 1 \) or \( 2.  \)  It is \( 16 \) if \( n = 3.  \)
  Indeed the above formula gives us

  \[
    g(1) = g(2) = 0, \quad g(3) = 16.
  \]

  Therefore, we can now generalise the above result as

  \[
    g(n) = 8(n - 1)(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 1.  \)  Therefore, for all \( n \ge 1, \)

  \[
    f(n) = \frac{g(n)}{2} = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \]

<p>
  Finally, in this section, we take a look at a simple and elegant
  solution that arrives at the closed-form solution in a more direct
  manner.  The analysis begins by looking at the smallest section of
  the board where two knights can attack each other.
</p>
<h3 id="minimal-attack-sections">Minimal Attack Sections<a href="#minimal-attack-sections"></a></h3>
<p>
  Consider a \( 2 \times 3 \) section of a board of size
  \( 3 \times 3 \) or larger.  Such a section has exactly two mutually
  attacking knight placements.

  two mutually attacking knight placements.

  <figcaption>
    Two mutually attacking knight placements on a \( 3 \times 2 \)
    section of a board
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  We call these \( 2 \times 3 \) and \( 3 \times 2 \) sections
  the <em>minimal attack sections</em> of a board, since no smaller
  section can contain a mutually attacking knight placement.
</p>
<p>
  Two distinct \( 2 \times 3 \) sections can share at most a \( 1
  \times 3 \) section, which is smaller than a minimal attack section.
  Consequently, no mutually attacking knight placement can be common
  to two distinct \( 2 \times 3 \) sections of a board.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, two distinct \( 3 \times 2 \) sections can share at most
  a \( 3 \times 1 \) section, again too small to contain a minimal
  attack section.  Therefore, they share no mutually attacking knight
  placement.
</p>
<p>
  A \( 2 \times 3 \) section and a \( 3 \times 2 \) section can share
  at most a \( 2 \times 2 \) section, which is still smaller than a
  minimal attack section, so they share no mutually attacking knight
  placement either.
</p>
<p>
  To summarise, any two minimal attack sections of the board yield
  distinct pairs of mutually attacking knight placements.  The total
  number of such placements is therefore exactly twice the number of
  minimal attack sections on the board.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-3">Closed Form Expression<a href="#closed-form-expression-3"></a></h3>
<p>
  In an \( n \times n \) board where \( n \ge 3, \) the left edge of a
  \( 2 \times 3 \) section can be placed in any one of the first \( n
  - 2 \) columns of the board.  Similarly, the top edge of such a
  section can be placed in any one of the first \( n - 1 \) rows of
  the board.  Therefore, the total number of distinct \( 2 \times 3 \)
  sections on the board is \( (n - 2)(n - 1).  \)
</p>
<p>
  By similar reasoning, the number of distinct \( 3 \times 2 \)
  sections on an \( n \times n \) board, where \( n \ge 3, \) is also
  \( (n - 1)(n - 2).  \)
</p>
<p>
  Let \( h(n) \) be the total number of minimal attack sections we can
  find on an \( n \times n \) board where \( n \ge 1.  \)  From the
  discussion in the previous two paragraphs, we know that \( h(n) =
  2(n - 1)(n - 2) \) for \( n \ge 3.  \)  Further, this formula for \(
  h(n) \) works for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \) as well since \( h(1)
  = h(2) = 0 \) and indeed a \( 1 \times 1 \) board or a
  \( 2 \times 2 \) board is too small to contain any minimal attack
  sections.  Therefore, for all \( n \ge 1, \) we get

  \[
    h(n) = 2(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \]

  Since each minimal attack section yields two mutually attacking
  knight placements, the total number of mutually attacking knight
  placements on an \( n \times n \) board is

  \[
    f(n) = 2h(n) = 4(n - 1)(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 1.  \)

  Consider the following infinite grid of numbers, where the numbers
  are arranged in a spiral-like manner, but the spiral reverses
  direction each time it reaches the edge of the grid:

  \begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrl}

  Before we explore this problem further, let us rewrite the zigzag
  number spiral grid in a cleaner form, omitting the arrows:

  \begin{array}{rrrrrl}
      1 &amp;   2 &amp;   9  &amp;  10 &amp;  25 &amp; \cd \\
      4 &amp;   3 &amp;   8  &amp;  11 &amp;  24 &amp; \cd \\
      5 &amp;   6 &amp;   7  &amp;  12 &amp;  23 &amp; \cd \\
     16 &amp;  15 &amp;  14  &amp;  13 &amp;  22 &amp; \cd \\
     17 &amp;  18 &amp;  19  &amp;  20 &amp;  21 &amp; \cd \\
    \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \vd  &amp; \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \dd
  \end{array}

  Let \( f(m, n) \) denote the number at the \( m \)th row and
  \( n \)th column.  For example, \( f(1, 1) = 1 \) and \( f(2, 5) =
  24.  \)  We want to find a closed-form expression for \( f(m, n).  \)
</p>
<p>
  Let us first clarify what we mean by a <em>closed-form
  expression</em>.  There is no universal definition of a closed-form
  expression, but the term typically refers to a mathematical
  expression involving variables and constants, built using a finite
  combination of basic operations: addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, division, integer exponents, roots with integer
  index and functions such as exponentials, logarithms and
  trigonometric functions.
</p>
<p>
  In this article, however, we need only addition, subtraction,
  division, squares and square roots.  This may be a bit of a spoiler,
  but I must mention that the \( \max \) function appears in the
  closed-form expressions we are about to see.  If you are concerned
  about whether functions like \( \max \) and \( \min \) are permitted
  in such expressions, note that

  \begin{align*}
    \max(m, n) &amp; = \frac{m + n + \sqrt{(m - n)^2}}{2}, \\
    \min(m, n) &amp; = \frac{m + n - \sqrt{(m - n)^2}}{2}.
  \end{align*}

  So \( \max \) and \( \min \) are simply shorthand for expressions
  involving addition, subtraction, division, squares and square roots.
  In the discussion that follows, we will use only the \( \max \)
  function.
</p>
<h2 id="patterns-on-the-edges">Patterns on the Edges<a href="#patterns-on-the-edges"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us begin by analysing the edge numbers.  Number the rows as \(
  1, 2, 3 \dots \) and the columns likewise.  Observe where the spiral
  touches the left edge and changes direction.  This happens only on
  even-numbered rows.  Similarly, each time the spiral touches the top
  edge and changes direction, it does so on odd-numbered columns.  In
  the following subsections, we take a closer look at this behaviour
  of the spiral.
</p>
<p>
  I should mention that this section takes a rather long path to
  arrive at the closed-form solution.  Personally, I enjoy such long
  tours.  If you prefer a more direct approach, feel free to skip
  ahead to
  <a href="#patterns-on-the-diagonal">Patterns on the Diagonal</a> for
  a shorter discussion that reaches the same result.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-edge-numbers">Computing Edge Numbers<a href="#computing-edge-numbers"></a></h3>
<p>
  Each time the spiral reaches the left edge of the grid, it does so
  at some \( m \)th row where \( m \) is even.  The \( m \times m \)
  subgrid formed by the first \( m \) rows and the first \( m \)
  columns contains \( m^2 \) consecutive numbers.  Since the numbers
  strictly increase as the spiral grows, the largest of these
  \( m^2 \) numbers must appear at the position where the spiral
  touches the left edge.  This is illustrated in the figure below.
</p>
<figure>
  \begin{array}{rrrr:rl}
     1     &amp;   2 &amp;   9  &amp;  10 &amp;  25 &amp; \cd \\

    \hdashline
    17     &amp;  18 &amp;  19  &amp;  20 &amp;  21 &amp; \cd \\
    \vd    &amp; \vd &amp; \vd  &amp; \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \dd
  \end{array}
  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the left edge on the \( 4 \)th row where the
    number is \( 4^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Whenever the spiral touches the left edge at the \( m \)th row
  (where \( m \) is even), the number in the first column of that row
  is \( m^2.  \)  Hence, we conclude that \( f(m, 1) = m^2 \) when \( m
  \) is even.  Immediately after touching the left edge, the spiral
  turns downwards into the first column of the next row.  Thus, in the
  next row, i.e. in the \( (m + 1) \)th row, we have \( f(m + 1, 1) =
  m^2 + 1, \) where \( m + 1 \) is odd.  This can be restated as \(
  f(m, 1) = (m - 1)^2 + 1 \) when \( m \) is odd.  Since \( f(1, 1) =
  1, \) we can summarise the two formulas we have found here as:

  \[
    f(m, 1) =
      \begin{cases}
        m^2           &amp; \text{if } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + 1 &amp; \text{if } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
      \end{cases}
  \]
</p>
<p>
  We can perform a similar analysis for the numbers at the top edge
  and note that whenever the spiral touches the top edge at the
  \( n \)th column (where \( n \) is odd), the number in the first row
  of that column is \( n^2.  \)  This is illustrated below.
</p>
<figure>

  \end{array}
  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the top edge on the \( 3 \)rd column where the
    number is \( 3^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Immediately after touching the top edge, the spiral turns right into
  the next column.  These observations give us the following formula
  for the numbers at the top edge:

  \[
    f(1, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        n^2           &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        (n - 1)^2 + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Next we will find a formula for any arbitrary number anywhere in the
  grid.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-all-grid-numbers-1">Computing All Grid Numbers<a href="#computing-all-grid-numbers-1"></a></h3>
<p>
 Since the spiral touches the left edge on even-numbered rows, then
 turns downwards into the next (odd-numbered) row and then starts
 moving right until the diagonal (where it changes direction again),
 the following two rules hold:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    On every odd-numbered row, as we go from left to right, the
    numbers increase until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
  <li>
    On every even-numbered row, as we go from left to right, the
    numbers decrease until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that all the numbers we considered in the above two points lie
  on or below the diagonal (or equivalently, on or to the left of the
  diagonal).  Therefore, on an odd-numbered row, we can find the
  numbers on or below the diagonal using the formula \( f(m, n) = f(m,
  1) + (n - 1), \) where \( m \) is odd.  Similarly, on even-numbered
  rows, we can find the numbers on or below the diagonal using the
  formula \( f(m, n) = f(m, 1) - (n - 1), \) where \( m \) is even.
</p>
<p>
  By a similar analysis, the following rules hold when we consider the
  numbers in a column:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    On every even-numbered column, as we go from top to bottom, the
    numbers increase until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
  <li>
    On every odd-numbered column, as we go from top to bottom, the
    numbers decrease until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now the numbers on or above the diagonal can be found using the
  formula \( f(m, n) = f(1, n) - (m - 1) \) when \( n \) is odd and \(
  f(m, n) = f(1, n) + (m - 1), \) when \( n \) is even.
</p>
<p>
  Can we determine from the values of \( m \) and \( n \) if the
  number \( f(m, n) \) is above the diagonal or below it?  Yes, if \(
  m \le n, \) then \( f(m, n) \) lies on or above the diagonal.
  However, if \( m \ge n, \) then \( f(m, n) \) lies on or below the
  diagonal.

  We now have everything we need to write a general formula for
  finding the numbers anywhere in the grid.  Using the four formulas
  and the two inequalities obtained in this section, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(1, n) + (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(1, n) - (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, 1) - (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, 1) + (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Using the equations for \( f(1, n) \) and \( f(m, 1) \) from the
  previous section, the above formulas can be rewritten as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n - 1)^2 + 1 + (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        n^2 - (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        m^2 - (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + 1 + (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Simplifying the expressions on the right-hand side, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n - 1)^2 + m
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        n^2 - m + 1
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        m^2 - n + 1
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + n
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  This is pretty good.  We now have a piecewise formula that works for
  any position in the grid.  Let us now explore whether we can express
  it as a single closed-form expression.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-1">Closed Form Expression<a href="#closed-form-expression-1"></a></h3>
<p>
  First, we will rewrite the piecewise formula from the previous
  section in the following form:

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n^2 - n + 1) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (n^2 - n + 1) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m^2 - m + 1) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m^2 - m + 1) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  This is the same formula, rewritten to reveal common patterns
  between the four expressions on the right-hand side.  In each
  expression, one variable plays the dominant role, occurring several
  times, while the other appears only once.  For example, in the first
  two expressions, \( n \) plays the dominant role whereas \( m \)
  occurs only once.  If we look closely, we realise that it is the
  variable that is greater than or equal to the other that plays the
  dominant role.  Therefore the first and third expressions may be
  written as

  \[
    \left( (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 \right) + (m - n).
  \]

  Similarly, the second and fourth expressions may be written as

  \[
    \left( (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 \right) - (m - n).
  \]

  We have made some progress towards a closed-form expression.  We
  have collapsed the four expressions in the piecewise formula to just
  two.  The only difference between them lies in the sign of the
  second term: it is positive when the dominant variable is even and
  negative when it is odd.  This observation allows us to unify both
  cases into a single expression:

  \[
    f(m, n) = (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  Now we have a closed-form expression for \( f(m, n) \) that gives
  the number at any position in the grid.
</p>
<h2 id="patterns-on-the-diagonal">Patterns on the Diagonal<a href="#patterns-on-the-diagonal"></a></h2>
<p>
  As mentioned earlier, there is a shorter route to the same
  closed-form expression.  This alternative approach is based on
  analysing the numbers along the diagonal of the grid.  We still need
  to examine the edge numbers, but not all of them as we did in the
  previous section.  Some of the reasoning about edge values will be
  repeated here to ensure this section is self-contained.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-diagonal-numbers">Computing Diagonal Numbers<a href="#computing-diagonal-numbers"></a></h3>
<p>
  A number on the diagonal has the same row number and column number.
  In other words, a diagonal number has the value \( f(n, n) \) for
  some positive integer \( n.  \)  Consider the case when \( n \) is
  even.  In this case, the diagonal number is on a segment of the
  spiral that is moving to the left.  The \( n \times n \) subgrid
  formed by the first \( n \) rows and the first \( n \) columns
  contains exactly \( n^2 \) consecutive numbers.  Since the diagonal
  number is on the last row of this subgrid and the numbers in this
  row increase as we move from right to left, the largest number in
  the subgrid must be on the left edge of this row.  Therefore the
  number at the left edge is \( f(n, 1) = n^2, \) where \( n \) is
  even.  This is illustrated below.
</p>

  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the left edge on the \( 4 \)th row where the
    number is \( 4^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  From the diagonal to the edge of the subgrid, there are \( n \)
  consecutive numbers.  In a sequence of \( n \) consecutive numbers,
  the difference between the maximum number and the minimum number is
  \( n - 1.  \)  Therefore, \( n^2 - f(n, n) = n - 1.  \)  This gives us

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \quad \text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
  \]
</p>
<p>
  Now consider the case when \( n \) is odd.
</p>
<figure>
  \begin{array}{rrr:rrl}

  \end{array}
  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the top edge on the \( 3 \)rd column where the
    number is \( 3^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  By a similar reasoning, for odd \( n, \) the \( n \)th column has
  numbers that increase as we move up from the diagonal number towards
  the top edge.  Therefore \( f(1, n) = n^2 \) and since \( n^2 - f(n,
  n) = n - 1, \) we again obtain

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \quad \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
  \]

  Since \( f(n, n) \) takes the same form for both odd and even
  \( n, \) we can write

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1
  \]

  for all positive integers \( n.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="computing-all-grid-numbers-2">Computing All Grid Numbers<a href="#computing-all-grid-numbers-2"></a></h3>
<p>
  If \( m \le n, \) then the number \( f(m, n) \) lies on or above the
  diagonal number \( f(n, n).  \)  If \( n \) is even, then the numbers
  decrease as we go from the diagonal up to the top edge.  Therefore
  \( f(m, n) \le f(n, n) \) and \( f(m, n) = f(n, n) - (n - m).  \)  If
  \( n \) is odd, then the numbers increase as we go from the diagonal
  up to the top edge and therefore \( f(m, n) \ge f(n, n) \) and \(
  f(m, n) = f(n, n) + (n - m).  \)
</p>
<p>
  If \( m \ge n, \) then the number \( f(m, n) \) lies on or below the
  diagonal number \( f(m, m).  \)  By a similar analysis, we find that
  \( f(m, n) = f(m, m) + (m - n) \) if \( n \) is even and \( f(m, n)
  = f(m, m) - (m - n) \) if \( n \) is odd.  We summarise these
  results as follows:

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(n, n) - (n - m)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(n, n) + (n - m)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Note that the above formula can be rewritten as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(n, n) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(n, n) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-2">Closed Form Expression<a href="#closed-form-expression-2"></a></h3>
<p>
  If we take a close look at the last formula in the previous section,
  we find that in each expression, one variable plays a dominant role,
  i.e. it occurs more frequently in the expression than the other.  In
  the first two expressions \( n \) plays the dominant role whereas in
  the last two expressions \( m \) plays the dominant role.  In fact,
  in each expression, the dominant variable is the one that is greater
  than or equal to the other.  With this in mind, we can rewrite the
  above formula as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } \max(m, n) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } \max(m, n) \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  The only difference between the expressions is the sign of the
  second term: it is positive when \( \max(m, n) \) is even and
  negative when \( \max(m, n) \) is odd.  As a result, we can rewrite
  the above formula as a single expression like this:

  \[
    f(m, n) = f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  Using the formula \( f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \) from the previous
  section, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) = (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  We arrive again at the same closed-form expression, this time by
  focusing on the diagonal of the grid.

  A negative number multiplied by another negative number results in a
  positive number.  Most of us learnt this rule during our primary or
  secondary school years.  'Negative times negative equals positive'
  was a phrase drummed into us during mathematics lessons.  In this
  article, we will prove this rule, not just for numbers but for any
  algebraic structure that, in a general sense, behaves somewhat like
  numbers.
</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="illustration">Illustration<a href="#illustration"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us begin with a quick illustration that shows why the product of
  two negative numbers must be positive for arithmetic to make sense.
  Consider

  \[
    7 \times 8 = 56.
  \]

  The above equation can also be written as

  \[
    (10 - 3) \times (10 - 2) = 56.
  \]

  Using the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction,
  we get

  \[
    (10 - 3) \times 10 + (10 - 3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Using the distributive property again, we have

  \[
    10 \times 10 + (-3) \times 10 + 10 \times (-2) + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Now, we will take it for granted that a positive times a negative is
  negative.  We will prove all of this rigorously later, but for now,
  we are just working through an illustration, so we will accept that
  rule and see where it leads.  The equation becomes:

  \[
    100 + (-30) + (-20) + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Adding the first three terms gives

  \[
    50 + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Subtracting \( 50 \) from both sides, we get

  \[
    (-3) \times (-2) = 6.
  \]

  What we have seen here is that if we accept \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \)
  and that positive times negative gives a negative result, then we
  must also accept that \( (-3) \times (-2) = 6.  \)
</p>
<h2 id="ring-axioms">Ring Axioms<a href="#ring-axioms"></a></h2>
<p>
  From this section onwards, we take a rigorous approach.  We want to
  show that the rule 'negative times negative equals positive' holds,
  in a general sense, for any set of elements that share certain
  properties with numbers.  As it turns out, these elements do not
  need to possess all the properties of complex numbers, real numbers
  or even rational numbers.  In fact, if they satisfy a small and
  specific set of properties held by the integers, then the rule still
  holds.  These properties are known as the <em>ring axioms</em>.
</p>
<p>
  A ring is an algebraic structure consisting of a set \( R \) with
  two binary operations \( + \) and \( \cdot, \) called addition and
  multiplication respectively, satisfying the following axioms:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c
      \in R, \) we have \( a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b \in
      R, \) we have \( a + b = b + a.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive identity:</strong> There exists an element \( 0
      \in R \) such that for all \( a \in R, \) we have \( a + 0 = a =
      0 + a.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive inverse:</strong> For each \( a \in R, \) there
      exists an element \( -a \in R \) such that \( a + (-a) = 0 =
      (-a) + a.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of multiplication:</strong> For all \( a,
      b, c \in R, \) we have \( a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b)
      \cdot c.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Left distributivity of multiplication over
      addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in R, \) we have \( a
      \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Right distributivity of multiplication over
      addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in R, \) we have \( (b +
      c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Note that we do not assume that the ring contains multiplicative
  identity, nor do we assume that multiplication is commutative.  Many
  familiar types of numbers form rings.  For example, the set of
  integers forms a ring with the usual addition and multiplication
  operations.  The sets of rational numbers, real numbers and complex
  numbers satisfy the ring axioms too.
</p>
<p>
  Rings need not consist of numbers; they may contain elements
  of <em>any</em> type.  As long as a set of elements, together with
  suitable addition and multiplication operations, satisfies the seven
  axioms above, it forms a ring.  For example, the set of all
  polynomials in the indeterminate \( t \) with coefficients in some
  ring \( R \) forms a ring under the usual addition and
  multiplication of polynomials.  Such a ring is called
  a <em>polynomial ring</em> and it is denoted \( R[t].  \)
</p>
<h2 id="closure-properties">Closure Properties<a href="#closure-properties"></a></h2>
<p>
  Some texts include the following additional axioms for the closure
  properties of a ring:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under addition:</strong> For all
      \( a, b \in R, \) we have \( a + b \in R.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under multiplication:</strong> For all \( a, b
      \in R, \) we have \( a \cdot b \in R.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  However, stating these axioms explicitly is usually considered
  redundant because a binary operation is closed by definition.  A
  binary operation \( \circ \) on a set \( M \) is defined to be a
  function

  \[
    \circ : M \times M \to M; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a \circ b.
  \]

  This definition automatically implies the closure property, since
  the domain and codomain are the same.  The addition and
  multiplication operations on a ring \( R \) may be defined as

  \begin{align*}
        + &amp;: R \times R \to R; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a + b, \\
    \cdot &amp;: R \times R \to R; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a \cdot b.
  \end{align*}

  These definitions imply that a ring is closed under addition and
  multiplication.  In practice, while deciding if some set \( R \)
  forms a ring, we should always verify that the addition and
  multiplication operations indeed have \( R \) as the codomain to
  confirm that the closure property holds.
</p>
<h2 id="inverse-of-inverse">Inverse of Inverse<a href="#inverse-of-inverse"></a></h2>
<p id="theorem-1">
  <strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.
    Then for all \( a \in R, \) we have

    \[
      -(-a) = a.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> This result follows directly from the additive
  inverse axiom.  First, observe that

  \[
    a + (-a) = 0.
  \]

  Therefore \( a \) is an additive inverse of \( -a, \) i.e.

  \[
    -(-a) = a.
  \]

  This completes the proof.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that this proof does not involve the multiplication operation
  of a ring at all.  In fact, it holds true in a more general
  algebraic structure known as a <em>group</em>, which requires only a
  binary operation with associativity, an identity element and
  inverses.  A ring, under addition, is also a group.  Since the proof
  relies solely on these additive group properties, this theorem holds
  for all groups.  However, for brevity and to avoid introducing group
  axioms separately, I have stated and proved this theorem in the
  context of rings.
</p>

  It is also worth noting that the additive identity is unique in a
  ring (as well as in any group), but since this fact is not needed
  for later results, its proof has been omitted.  Even if,
  hypothetically, there were two distinct additive identities, \( 0 \)
  and \( 0', \) in a ring (there are not, of course), the arguments
  below would still hold if we simply focus on \( 0.  \)

  <strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.  Then
    for all \( a \in R, \) we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> Using the additive identity axiom, we get

  \[
    0 + 0 = 0.
  \]

  Multiplying both sides on the left by \( a, \) we get

  \[
    a \cdot (0 + 0) = a \cdot 0.
  \]

  Using the left distributivity axiom, we get

  \[
    a \cdot 0 + a \cdot 0 = a \cdot 0.
  \]

  Let \( b = a \cdot 0.  \)  Then

  \[
    b + b = b.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication, \( b \in R.  \)  By the
  additive inverse axiom, there exists \( -b \in R \) such that \( b +
  (-b) = 0.  \)  Adding \( -b \) to both sides of the above equation,
  we get

  \[
    (b + b) + (-b) = b + (-b).
  \]

  By associativity of addition in a ring, we get

  \[
    b + (b + (-b)) = b + (-b).
  \]

  Since \( b + (-b) = 0, \) the above equation becomes

  \[
    b + 0 = 0.
  \]

  By the additive identity axiom, we get

  \[
    b = 0.
  \]

  Since \( b = a \cdot 0, \) the above equation may be written as

  \[
    a \cdot 0 = 0.
  \]

  A similar argument shows that

  \[
    0 \cdot a = 0.

  This completes the proof.

  <em>Proof.</em>
  From <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a>, we know that

    (-a) \cdot (-b) = -(-(a \cdot b)).
  \]

  Now using <a href="#theorem-1">Theorem 1</a>, the right-hand side

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b.
  \]

  This completes the proof.
</p>
<h2 id="alternate-proof">Alternate Proof<a href="#alternate-proof"></a></h2>
<p>
  The above sequence of theorems is not the only way to arrive
  at <a href="#theorem-4">Theorem 4</a>.  There are other ways to
  reach this result as well.  Let us briefly discuss another such
  proof.  From <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a> we know that \( a
  \cdot b \) is the additive inverse of \( a \cdot (-b).  \)  In a very
  similar way, we can show that \( (-a) \cdot (-b) \) is also the
  additive inverse of \( a \cdot (-b).  \)  The proof goes as follows:

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) + a \cdot (-b)
    = (-a + a) \cdot (-b)
    = 0 \cdot (-b)
    = 0.
  \]

  Note that we used <a href="#theorem-2">Theorem 2</a> again for the
  last equality.  So now we know that both \( (-a) \cdot (-b) \) and
  \( a \cdot b \) are additive inverses of \( a \cdot (-b).  \)  Does
  this mean that \( (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b?  \)  Yes, since the
  additive inverse of an element is unique in a ring.  Let us prove
  this now.

  Let \( b \) and \( c \) be additive inverses of \( a.  \)  Then \( a
  + b = b + a = 0 \) and \( a + c = c + a = 0.  \)  Using this, we get

  \[
    b = b + 0 = b + (a + c) = (b + a) + c = 0 + c = c.
  \]

  Since \( (-a) \cdot (-b) \) and \( a \cdot b \) are additive
  inverses of the same element \(a \cdot (-b) \) and since the
  additive inverse of an element is unique in a ring, it follows that

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b.
  \]

  Note that we do not need <a href="#theorem-1">Theorem 1</a> in this
  alternate proof but we introduced a new theorem about the uniqueness
  of the additive inverse to complete this proof.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  Theorems 1 to 4 establish certain algebraic properties that hold in
  any ring.  Although these results were proven abstractly for rings,
  they reflect properties we are already familiar with from our
  experience with numbers.  For example, in the ring of integers, we
  observe \( -(-2) = 2 \) which is a specific case
  of <a href="#theorem-1">Theorem 1</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, <a href="#theorem-2">Theorem 2</a> confirms the
  well-known fact that multiplying any integer by \( 0 \) yields
  \( 0.  \)  For example, \( 2 \cdot 0 = 0.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Then <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a> implies the rule that
  multiplying a positive number by a negative number yields a negative
  result.  For example, \( 2 \cdot (-3) = -(2 \cdot 3) = -6.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Finally, <a href="#theorem-4">Theorem 4</a> implies that the product
  of two negative numbers is positive.  For example, \( (-2) \cdot
  (-3) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6.  \)
</p>
<p>
  These familiar results are not limited to the ring of integers.  The
  results hold in any ring, including polynomial rings, rings of
  integers modulo a fixed positive integer and many other algebraic
  systems.  These results demonstrate how the ring axioms formalise
  familiar arithmetic rules within a more general algebraic framework.

  A field has exactly two ideals: the zero ideal, which contains only
  the additive identity and the whole field itself.  These are known
  as trivial ideals.  Further if a commutative ring, with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities, has no ideals other than the
  trivial ones, then it must be a field.  These two facts are elegant
  in their symmetry and simplicity.  In this article, we will explore
  why these facts are true.  Familiarity with algebraic structures
  such as groups, rings and fields is assumed.

<h2 id="definition-of-ideals">Definition of Ideals<a href="#definition-of-ideals"></a></h2>
<p>
  A left ideal of a ring \( R \) is a subset \( I \subseteq R \) such
  that \( I \) is an additive subgroup of \( R \) and for all \( a \in
  I \) and \( r \in R, \) we have \( r \cdot a \in I.  \)  We say that
  a left ideal absorbs multiplication from the left by any ring
  element; or equivalently, that it is closed under left
  multiplication by any ring element.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, a right ideal of a ring \( R \) is a subset \( I
  \subseteq R \) such that \( I \) is an additive subgroup of \( R \)
  and for all \( a \in I \) and \( r \in R, \) we have \( a \cdot r
  \in I.  \)  We say that a right ideal absorbs multiplication from the
  right by any ring element; or equivalently, that it is closed under
  right multiplication by any ring element.
</p>
<p>
  In a commutative ring \( R, \) every left ideal is also a right
  ideal and vice versa.  This is because for all \( a \in I \) and \(
  r \in R, \) we have \( r \cdot a = a \cdot r.  \)  Therefore, when
  working with commutative rings, we do not need to distinguish
  between left and right ideals and we simply refer to them as ideals.
  In this case, the ideal is said to absorb multiplication by any ring
  element; or equivalently, it is said to be closed under
  multiplication by any ring element.
</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-ideals">Examples of Ideals<a href="#examples-of-ideals"></a></h2>
<p>
  Consider the set of even integers

  \[
    \langle 2 \rangle = \{ 2n : n \in \mathbb{Z} \}.
  \]

  This is an ideal of \( \mathbb{Z}.  \)  Indeed, if we multiply any
  even integer by any integer, the result is an even integer.  In
  other words, the set of even integers absorbs multiplication by any
  integer.  Equivalently, the set of even integers is closed under
  multiplication by any integer.
</p>
<p>
  Let us see another example.  Consider the ring of polynomials in the
  indeterminate \( t \) with integer coefficients, denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}[t].  \)  The set

  \[
    \langle 2, t \rangle = \{ 2f + tg : f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[t] \}
  \]

  is an ideal of \( \mathbb{Z}[t].  \)  Every element of this ideal is
  a linear combination of \( 2 \) and \( t \) with polynomial
  coefficients.  If we take any element \( 2f + tg \in \langle 2, t
  \rangle \) where \( f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[t] \) and multiply it by any
  polynomial \( h \in \mathbb{Z}[t], \) we obtain \( 2fh + tgh, \)
  which is again an element of \( \langle 2, t \rangle.  \)  Hence \(
  \langle 2, t \rangle \) absorbs multiplication by any element of \(
  \mathbb{Z}[t], \) i.e. it is closed under multiplication by elements
  of \( \mathbb{Z}[t].  \)
</p>
<h2 id="known-results">Known Results<a href="#known-results"></a></h2>
<p>
  For the sake of brevity, we assume the following standard results.
</p>
<p id="zero-multiplication">
  <strong>Proposition 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring.  Then, for all \( a \in R, \) we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p id="principal-ideal">
  <strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring and let \( a \in R.  \)  Then

    \begin{align*}
      I_L &amp;= \{ r \cdot a : r \in R \}, \\
      I_R &amp;= \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}
    \end{align*}

    are respectively a left ideal and a right ideal of \( R.  \)  If \(
    R \) is commutative, then \( I_L = I_R \) and we write

    \[
      \langle a \rangle = \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}
    \]

    and say that \( \langle a \rangle \) is an ideal of \( R \)
    generated by \( a.  \)
  </em>
</p>
<h2 id="ideals-of-fields">Ideals of Fields<a href="#ideals-of-fields"></a></h2>
<p>
  In this section, we show that a field \( K \) has only two ideals:
  \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) itself.
</p>
<p>
  Clearly \( \{ 0 \} \) is an ideal of \( K, \) as it satisfies the
  definition of an ideal.  It is the trivial additive subgroup of \(
  K \) and by <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>, for
  all \( r \in K, \) we have \( r \cdot 0 = 0 \in \{ 0 \}.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Now \( K \) is also an ideal of itself.  Since \( K \) is an additive
  group by the definition of a field, it is an additive subgroup of
  itself.  Moreover, as a field, \( K \) is closed under
  multiplication, so for all \( a, r \in K \) we have \( a \cdot r \in
  K.  \)
</p>
<p>
  We will now show that \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) are
  the <em>only</em> ideals of \( K.  \)  Let \( I \) be an ideal of \(
  K.  \)  There are two cases to consider: \( I = \{ 0 \} \) and \( I
  \ne \{ 0 \}.  \)  Suppose \( I \ne \{ 0 \}.  \)  Then there exists a
  non-zero element \( b \in I.  \)  Since \( b \ne 0 \) and \( K \) is
  a field, \( b \) has a multiplicative inverse \( b^{-1} \in K.  \)
  Since \( b \in I, \) \( b^{-1} \in K \) and \( I \) is closed under
  multiplication by any element of \( K, \) we have

  \[
    1 = b \cdot b^{-1} \in I.
  \]

  Now, let \( c \in K.  \)  Since \( 1 \in I, \) \( c \in K \) and \(
  I \) is an ideal of \( K, \) we get

  \[
    c = 1 \cdot c \in I.
  \]

  Thus \( K \subseteq I \) and since \( I \subseteq K \) by
  definition, we conclude \( I = K.  \)  Therefore the only ideals of
  \( K \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) itself.
</p>
<h2 id="rings-with-trivial-ideals">Rings With Trivial Ideals<a href="#rings-with-trivial-ideals"></a></h2>
<p>
  We now show that if \( R \) is a commutative ring with \( 1 \ne 0 \)
  and the only ideals of \( R \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( R \) itself,
  then \( R \) must be a field.  To do this, we first show that every
  non-zero element of \( R \) has a multiplicative inverse in \( R.  \)
  Let \( a \in R \) with \( a \ne 0.  \)  We now show that there exists
  a multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in R.  \)
  By <a href="#principal-ideal">Proposition 2</a>, the set

  \[
    \langle a \rangle = \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}.
  \]

  is an ideal of \( R.  \)  Since \( a = a \cdot 1 \in \langle a
  \rangle, \) we have \( \langle a \rangle \ne \{ 0 \}.  \)  By
  assumption, the only ideals of \( R \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and
  \( R, \) so it must be that \( \langle a \rangle = R.  \)  Therefore
  \( 1 \in \langle a \rangle \) and

  \[
    1 = a \cdot s
  \]

  for some \( s \in R.  \)  Thus \( a \) has a multiplicative inverse
  \( s \in R \) and this holds for every non-zero \( a \in R.  \)
</p>
<p>
  The remaining properties of fields, namely, associativity and
  commutativity of addition and multiplication, the existence of
  distinct additive and multiplicative identities, the existence of
  additive inverses and the distributivity of multiplication over
  addition, are inherited from the ring \( R.  \)  Therefore \( R \) is
  a field.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  To summarise, any commutative ring with distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities that has only trivial ideals is a field
  and every field has only trivial ideals.
</p>
<p>
  Note that every field is also a commutative ring with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities.  Therefore, we can say that
  every field is a commutative ring with distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities and only trivial ideals and vice versa.
  It is neat how the two facts align so nicely.

<p>
  In this article, we explore a few well-known results from abstract
  algebra pertaining to fields and integral domains.  We ask ourselves
  whether every field is an integral domain and whether every integral
  domain is a field.  We begin with the definition of an integral
  domain, discuss a few established results and then proceed to answer
  these questions.  Familiarity with algebraic structures such as
  rings and fields is assumed.

<h2 id="definition-of-integral-domain">Definition of Integral Domain<a href="#definition-of-integral-domain"></a></h2>
<p>
  An <em>integral domain</em> is a commutative ring, with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities, in which the product of any
  two non-zero elements is also non-zero.
</p>
<p>
  Equivalently, an integral domain is a commutative ring, with
  distinct additive and multiplicative identities, such that if the
  product of two elements is zero, then one of the elements must be
  zero.
</p>
<p>
  Using standard notation, we can write that a commutative ring
  \( R \) is an integral domain if \( 0 \ne 1 \) and for
  \( a, b \in R, \)

  \[
    a \ne 0 \text{ and } b \ne 0 \implies a \cdot b \ne 0
  \]

  or equivalently,

  \[
    a \cdot b = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0.
  \]

  There are many other alternative ways to define an integral domain
  which are all equivalent.  In a ring \( R, \) a <em>zero
  divisor</em> is a non-zero element \( a \in R \) such that there
  exists a non-zero element \( b \in R \) with \( ab = 0.  \)  With
  this definition of a zero divisor, we can define an integral domain
  to be a unital commutative ring, with \( 0 \ne 1, \) that has no
  zero divisors.
</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-integral-domain">Examples of Integral Domains<a href="#examples-of-integral-domain"></a></h2>
<p>
  The ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an integral domain since
  the product of two non-zero integers is non-zero.  The field of
  rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) is also an integral domain.  The
  ring of polynomials in the indeterminate \( t \) with coefficients
  in an integral domain \( R, \) denoted \( R[t], \) is an integral
  domain as well.
</p>
<p>
  The ring of integers modulo 5, denoted \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) is an
  integral domain.  However, the ring of integers modulo 6, denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}_6, \) is not an integral domain since \( 2 \cdot 3 = 0 \)
  in \( \mathbb{Z}_6.  \)  In other words, \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \) has zero
  divisors, namely \( 2 \) and \( 3, \) so it is not an integral
  domain.  In fact, the ring of integers modulo \( n, \) denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}_n \) is an integral domain if and only if \( n \) is
  prime.
</p>
<h2 id="known-results">Known Results<a href="#known-results"></a></h2>
<p>
  For the sake of brevity, we assume the following known results.
</p>
<p id="zero-multiplication">
  <strong>Proposition 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring.  Then, for all \( a \in R, \) we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p id="cancellation-property">
  <strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( D \) be an integral domain.  Then, for all \( a, b, c \in D \) such
    that \( a \ne 0, \) we have

    \[
      a \cdot b = a \cdot c \implies b = c.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The second result is also known as the <em>cancellation property of
  integral domains</em>.
</p>
<h2 id="on-distinct-identities">On Distinct Identities<a href="#on-distinct-identities"></a></h2>
<p>
  We have been mentioning the distinctiveness of the additive and
  multiplicative identities as a property of an integral domain.  Some
  texts express this more concisely by saying that an integral domain
  is a <em>non-zero</em> unital commutative ring without zero
  divisors, i.e. the zero ring \( \{ 0 \} \) is excluded from the
  definition.
</p>
<p>
  This follows directly from
  <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>.  If
  \( 0 = 1 \in R, \) then for all \( r \in R, \) we get

  \[
    r = r \cdot 1 = r \cdot 0 = 0
  \]

  which means that every element of \( R \) is zero, i.e. \( R = \{ 0
  \}.  \)  To summarise

  \[
    0 = 1 \in R \implies R = \{ 0 \}
  \]

  or equivalently, for a ring \( R \) with unity,

  \[
    R \ne \{ 0 \} \implies 0 \ne 1.
  \]

  Further, if \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) are two distinct elements of
  \( R, \) then \( R \) has at least two elements, so for a ring
  \( R \) with unity,

  \[
    0 \ne 1 \implies R \ne \{ 0 \}
  \]

  Therefore, a ring with unity has distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities if and only if it is a non-zero ring.  This
  is why an integral domain can also be defined as a non-zero unital
  commutative ring without zero divisors.
</p>
<h2 id="every-field-is-an-integral-domain">Every Field Is an Integral Domain<a href="#every-field-is-an-integral-domain"></a></h2>
<p>
  We now show that every field is indeed an integral domain.  Let
  \(F \) be a field and let \( a, b \in F \) such that \( ab = 0.  \)
  There are two cases to consider: \( a = 0 \) and \( a \ne 0.  \)  If
  \( a = 0, \) we are done.
</p>
<p>
  Now suppose \( a \ne 0.  \)  Then by the properties of fields, there exists a
  multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in F \) such that \( a \cdot
  a^{-1} = 1.  \)  Then using the properties of fields, we get

  \[
    b = b \cdot 1 = b \cdot (a \cdot a^{-1}) = (a \cdot b) \cdot
    a^{-1} = 0 \cdot a^{-1} = 0.
  \]

  The last equality follows from
  <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>.  We have shown
  that if \( ab = 0, \) then either \( a = 0 \) or \( b = 0.  \)
  Therefore, if both \( a \ne 0 \) and \( b \ne 0, \) then it must be
  that \( ab \ne 0.  \)  Therefore \( F \) is an integral domain.
</p>
<h2 id="infinite-integral-domains">Infinite Integral Domains<a href="#infinite-integral-domains"></a></h2>
<p>
  Now we arrive at the next natural question.  Is every integral
  domain a field?
</p>
<p>
  The ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an integral domain but it
  is not a field since \( 2 \in \mathbb{Z}, \) but \( 2^{-1} \notin
  \mathbb{Z}.  \)  Therefore, \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an example of an
  infinite integral domain that is not a field.
</p>
<p>
  Next we ask ourselves: Is every infinite integral domain not a
  field?  Not quite!  Some infinite integral domains are, in fact,
  fields.  This follows directly from the result in the previous
  section.  Every field is an integral domain and there are plenty of
  infinite fields, so they must all be integral domains too.  Consider
  the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) or the field of
  complex numbers \( \mathbb{C}.  \)  Since these are fields, they are
  also integral domains.  So, clearly, there are infinite integral
  domains that are also fields.
</p>
<h2 id="every-finite-integral-domain-is-a-field">Every Finite Integral Domain Is a Field<a href="#every-finite-integral-domain-is-a-field"></a></h2>
<p>
  We will now turn our attention to finite integral domains.  Is every
  finite integral domain a field?  Yes!  This can be shown as follows.
</p>
<p>
  Let \( D \) be a finite integral domain.  Let \( a \in D \) with \(
  a \ne 0.  \)  Consider the set

  \[
    A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication, every element of
  \( A \) belongs to \( D, \) so \( A \subseteq D.  \)  Since \( D \)
  is finite, \( A \) is finite too.  Therefore, by the pigeonhole
  principle, there exist integers \( m \gt n \ge 0 \) such that

  \[
    a^m = a^n
  \]

  This equation can be rewritten as

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} \cdot a^n = 1 \cdot a^n.
  \]

  Since \( a \) is a non-zero element of an integral domain, it
  follows that \( a^n \ne 0.  \)  Therefore we can use
  <a href="#cancellation-property">Proposition 2</a> (the cancellation
  property of integral domains) to get

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication and since \( m - n - 1
  \ge 0, \) it follows that \( a^{m - n - 1} \in D.  \)  Thus every
  non-zero element \( a \in D \) has a multiplicative inverse in
  \( D.  \)  This establishes the multiplicative inverse property of a
  field.
</p>
<p>
  Since an integral domain has distinct additive and multiplicative
  identities, it satisfies two additional field properties: the
  existence of an additive identity and a distinct multiplicative
  identity.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the remaining field properties are inherited from the ring
  structure, i.e. associativity and commutativity of addition and
  multiplication, the existence of additive inverses and the
  distributivity of multiplication over addition all hold in \( D, \)
  since they hold in any ring.  Thus, \( D \) satisfies all the field
  properties.  Therefore \( D \) is a field.
</p>
<h3 id="alternate-proof">Alternate Proof<a href="#alternate-proof"></a></h3>
<p>
  The proof in the previous section presents what I initially came up
  with while working through these concepts and proving these results
  for myself.  However, I later found that there is another proof that
  is quite popular in the literature.  This alternate proof differs in
  one key aspect: it does not invoke the cancellation property of
  integral domains stated in
  <a href="#cancellation-property">Proposition 2</a>.  Let us examine
  this alternate proof.
</p>
<p>
  As before, we consider the set \( A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}
  \subseteq D, \) where \( a \in D \) and \( a \ne 0 \) and we obtain
  the equation

  \[
    a^m = a^n
  \]

  for some integers \( m \gt n \ge 0.  \)  As before, we use the fact
  that \( a \) is an element of an integral domain to conclude that \(
  a^n \ne 0.  \)  Now adding the additive inverse of \( a^n \) to both
  sides we get

  \[
    a^m - a^n = 0.
  \]

  Using the distributivity property of rings, we get

  \[
    a^n (a^{m - n} - 1) = 0
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under addition and multiplication, both \(
  a^n \) and \( a^{m - n} - 1 \) belong to \( D.  \)  As \( D \) is an
  integral domain and \( a^n \ne 0, \) we conclude that \( a^{m - n} -
  1 = 0.  \)  Therefore \( a^{m - n} = 1.  \)  Since \( m - n \ge 1, \)
  we can write:

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
  \]

  Therefore every non-zero element \( a \in D \) has a multiplicative
  inverse in \( D.  \)  The remaining properties of a field are
  established in the same manner as in the previous section.  Hence,
  if \( D \) is a finite integral domain, then it is also a field.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  We now summarise all the results here before concluding the article:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Every field is an integral domain.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every <em>finite</em> integral domain is a field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some infinite integral domains are not fields.  A convenient
    example is the set of integers \( \mathbb{Z}.  \)
  </li>
  <li>
    Some infinite integral domains are fields.  Every infinite field,
    such as \( \mathbb{Q}, \) \( \mathbb{R} \) or \( \mathbb{C} \) is
    an example.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is worth reiterating here that the fourth result in the summary
  above follows from the fact that every field is an integral domain.
  These results reveal how structure and size interact in algebraic
  systems.  It is interesting how simply being finite guarantees that
  an integral domain is a field.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>
  This post illustrates a key lemma that is used in proving
  the <em>fundamental theorem of Galois theory</em> (FTGT).  Note that
  FTGT is not covered in this post.  The focus of this post is on
  understanding and proving this lemma only.  Here is the lemma from
  the book <em>Galois Theory</em>, 5th ed. by Stewart (2023):
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    <strong>Lemma 12.1.</strong>
    <em>
      Suppose that \( L/K \) is a field extension, \( M \) is an
      intermediate field, and \( \tau \) is a \( K \)-automorphism of \(
      L.  \)  Then \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^{*}.  \)
    </em>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  The notation \( M^* \) denotes the group of all
  \( M \)-automorphisms of \( L \) with composition as the group
  operation.  Note that Stewart writes \( \tau(M)^{*} = \tau M^*
  \tau^{-1} \) while stating the lemma but I have reversed the LHS and
  RHS to maintain consistency with the equations that appear in the
  discussion below.
</p>
<p>
  To build intuition for this lemma, I'll first present an
  illustration, followed by a proof.  The discussion below assumes
  familiarity with field extensions and field automorphisms, as
  several notations and results from these areas will be used
  implicitly without detailed justification.  This post is meant to
  serve as a set of notes on the lemma, not a comprehensive tutorial.

</ul>
<h2 id="illustration">Illustration<a href="#illustration"></a></h2>
<h3 id="concrete-example">Concrete Example<a href="#concrete-example"></a></h3>
<p>
  Let \( L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}), \) \( K = \mathbb{Q} \)
  and \( M = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}).  \)  Note that

  \begin{align*}
    L &amp;= \{ a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} : a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Q} \}, \\
    M &amp;= \{ k + l \sqrt{2} : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Now the group of \( K \)-automorphisms of \( L \) is

  \[
    K^* = \{\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3, \phi_4 \}
  \]

  where each \( \phi_i \) is given by

  \begin{align*}
    \phi_1 &amp;:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_2 &amp;:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a - b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} - d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_3 &amp;:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a + b \sqrt{2} - c \sqrt{3} - d \sqrt{6}, \\

    \phi_4 &amp;:
    a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \mapsto
    a - b \sqrt{2} - c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6}.
  \end{align*}

  Then \( M^* = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \}.  \)  Let \( \tau = \phi_2.  \)
  Then

  \begin{align*}
  \tau(M)
    &amp;= \{ \tau(x) : x \in \mathbb{M} \} \\
    &amp;= \{ \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \} \\
    &amp;= \{ k - l \sqrt{2} : k, l \in \mathbb{Q} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Note that in this case we ended up with \( \tau(M) = M \) but we
  will be careful not to utilise this fact.  We will ensure that the
  steps below work without assuming \( \tau(M) = M.  \)  Next we find

  \begin{equation}
    \tau(M)^* = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \}.
    \label{eq-tau-m-ast}
  \end{equation}

  Now

  \begin{align*}
    \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
    &amp;= \{ \tau \gamma \tau^{-1} : \gamma \in {M^*} \} \\
    &amp;= \{ \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1}, \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Let us now find out how each element of \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \)
  transforms the elements of \( L.  \)  For all \( a + b \sqrt{2} + c
  \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6} \in L, \) we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1})(a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6})
    &amp;= (\tau \phi_1)(a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &amp;= \tau (a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &amp;= a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}).
  \end{align*}

  Therefore

  \[
    \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1} = \phi_1.
  \]

  Similarly,

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1})(a + b \sqrt{2} + c \sqrt{3} + d \sqrt{6})
    &amp;= (\tau \phi_3)(a - b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &amp;= \tau (a - b\sqrt{2} - c\sqrt{3} + d\sqrt{6}) \\
    &amp;= a + b\sqrt{2} - c\sqrt{3} - d\sqrt{6}.
  \end{align*}

  Therefore

  \[
    \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} = \phi_3.
  \]

  We have shown that

  \begin{equation}
    \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \{ \phi_1, \phi_3 \}.
    \label{eq-tau-coset}
  \end{equation}

  From \( \eqnref{eq-tau-m-ast}{1} \) and \( \eqnref{eq-tau-coset}{2} \)
  we see that

  \[
     \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^*.
  \]

  Since we are working with a concrete example of \( \tau \) here, we
  know exactly how it behaves, so we succeeded in demonstrating the
  above equality.  However, in a general proof, \( \tau \) is going to
  be an arbitrary \( K \)-automorphism of \( L, \) so we cannot know
  exactly how it behaves and as a result, we cannot obtain the above
  equation directly.  Therefore, in a general proof, we we will first
  show that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^* \) and then we
  will show that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq \tau(M)^* \) in order
  to prove the above equation.
</p>
<h3 id="lhs-subset-of-rhs">LHS &sube; RHS<a href="#lhs-subset-of-rhs"></a></h3>
<p>
  Once again, let us see how each element of \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \)
  transforms the elements of \( \tau(M).  \)  Note that this time we
  are not going to examine how they transform arbitrary elements of \(
  L.  \)  We are only going to see how they transform the elements of
  \( \tau(M).  \)  For all \( k - l \sqrt{2} \in \tau(M), \) we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1})(k - l \sqrt{2})
    &amp;= (\tau \phi_1)(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= k - l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Similarly, for all \( k - l \sqrt{2} \in \tau(M), \) we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1})(k - l \sqrt{2})
    &amp;= (\tau \phi_3)(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= \tau(k + l \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= k - l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Note above that both \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_3 \) fix \( k + l
  \sqrt{2} \in M \) because \( \phi_1, \phi_2 \in M^*, \) the set of
  \( M \)-automorphisms of \( L.  \)  This detail will be used in the
  general proof.
</p>
<p>
  Since both \( \tau \phi_1 \tau^{-1} \) and
  \( \tau \phi_3 \tau^{-1} \) fix the elements of \( \tau(M), \) they
  are both \( \tau(M) \)-automorphisms of \( L.  \)  Therefore \( \tau
  M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^{*}.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="lhs-superset-of-rhs">LHS &supe; RHS<a href="#lhs-superset-of-rhs"></a></h3>
<p>
  Consider the set \( \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau \) and examine how its
  elements transform the elements of \( M.  \)  For all \( k + l
  \sqrt{2} \in M, \) we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau^{-1} \phi_1 \tau)(k + l \sqrt{2})
    &amp;= (\tau^{-1} \phi_1)(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= \tau^{-1}(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= k + l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Similarly, for all \( k + l \sqrt{2} \in M, \) we get

  \begin{align*}
    (\tau^{-1} \phi_3 \tau)(k + l \sqrt{2})
    &amp;= (\tau^{-1} \phi_3)(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= \tau^{-1}(k - \sqrt{2}) \\
    &amp;= k + l \sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}

  Here both \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_3 \) fix \( k - l \sqrt{2} \in
  \tau(M) \) because \( \phi_1, \phi_2 \in \tau(M)^*, \) the set of \(
  \tau(M) \)-automorphisms of \( L.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Since both \( \tau^{-1} \phi_1 \tau \) and
  \( \tau^{-1} \phi_3 \tau \) fix the elements of \( M, \) they are
  both \( M \)-automorphisms of \( L.  \)  Therefore \( \tau^{-1}
  \tau(M)^* \tau \subseteq M^* \) which implies \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
  \supseteq \tau(M)^*.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="lhs-equals-rhs">LHS = RHS<a href="#lhs-equals-rhs"></a></h3>
<p>
  The previous two sections complete the illustration of the lemma
  with the chosen example.  We have shown that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1}
  \subseteq \tau(M)^{*} \) and \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq
  \tau(M)^*.  \)  Therefore \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^*.  \)
</p>
<h2 id="proof">Proof<a href="#proof"></a></h2>
<p>
  The ideas presented in the previous sections will now be extended to
  formulate a general proof.  For clarity, the lemma is stated once
  again below before proceeding with the proof.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Lemma 12.1.</strong>
  <em>
    Suppose that \( L/K \) is a field extension, \( M \) is an
    intermediate field, and \( \tau \) is a \( K \)-automorphism of \(
    L.  \)  Then \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^{*}.  \)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>

  For all \( \gamma \in M^*, \) \( x' \in \tau(M), \) we use the
  notation \( x = \tau^{-1}(x') \in M \) and get

  \[
    (\tau \gamma \tau^{-1})(x') = (\tau \gamma)(x) = \tau(x) = x'.
  \]

  In the second equality above, we have used the fact that \( \gamma
  \in M^* \) which implies that \( \gamma \) is an \( M \)-automorphism
  of \( L \) which allows us to conclude that \( \gamma(x) = x \) for
  \( x \in M.  \)  Since every \( \tau \gamma \tau^{-1} \in \tau M^*
  \tau^{-1} \) fixes all elements \( x' \in \tau(M), \) each \( \tau
  \gamma \tau^{-1} \) must be a \( \tau(M) \)-automorphism of \( L.  \)
  Thus \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^*.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, for all \( \gamma' \in \tau(M)^*, \) \( x \in M, \) we
  use the notation \( x' = \tau(x) \in \tau(M) \) and get

  \[
  (\tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau)(x) = (\tau^{-1} \gamma')(x') = \tau^{-1}(x') = x.
  \]

  In the second equality above, we have used the fact that \( \gamma'
  \in \tau(M)^* \) which implies that \( \gamma' \) is an
  \( \tau(M) \)-automorphism of \( L \) which allows us to conclude
  that \( \gamma'(x') = x' \) for \( x' \in \tau(M).  \)  Since every
  \( \tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau \in \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau \) fixes all
  elements \( x \in M, \) each \( \tau^{-1} \gamma' \tau \) must be an
  \( M \)-automorphism of \( L.  \)  Thus \( \tau^{-1} \tau(M)^* \tau
  \subseteq M^*.  \)  This implies \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq
  \tau(M)^*.  \)
</p>
<p>
  We have shown that \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \subseteq \tau(M)^* \) and
  \( \tau M^* \tau^{-1} \supseteq \tau(M)^*.  \)  Therefore \( \tau M^*
  \tau^{-1} = \tau(M)^*.  \)

  In mathematics, a function \( f \) from a set \( X \) to a set \(
  Y \) is a relation that associates each element of \( X \) with
  exactly one element of \( Y.  \)  This page describes the commonly
  used notation, terminology and concepts pertaining to functions.
</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents<a href="#contents"></a></h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="definition">Definition<a href="#definition"></a></h2>
<p>
  A function \( f \) from a set \( X \) to a set \( Y \) is a binary
  relation \( R \) that satisfies the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    \( R \subseteq \{ (x, y) \mid x \in X, y \in Y \} = X \times Y.  \)
  </li>
  <li>
    For every \( x \in X, \) there exists \( y \in Y \) such that \(
    (x, y) \in R.  \)
  </li>
  <li>
    If \( (x, y) \in R \) and \( (x, z) \in R, \) then \( y = z.  \)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The set \( X \) is called the domain of \( f \) and the set \( Y \)
  is called the codomain of \( f.  \)  The relation \( R \) is also
  known as the graph of \( f.  \)
</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation<a href="#notation"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let \( f \) be a function from a set \( X \) to a set \( Y.  \)  Then
  the name \( f \) represents the function and the notation \( f(x) \)
  represents the application of the function to the argument \( x, \)
  i.e. \( f(x) \) represents the value of \( f \) for the element \( x
  \in X.  \)  In other words, for all \( x \in X, \) we have \( (x,
  f(x)) \in R.  \)
</p>
<p>
  A function \( f \) with domain \( X \) and codomain \( Y \) is also
  written as \( f : X \to Y.  \)  The function \( f \) may also be
  written as \( x \mapsto f(x).  \)  This notation specifies a function
  that maps \( x \) to \( f(x).  \)
</p>
<p>
  Formally, \( f(x) \) denotes the application of the function \( f \)
  to the argument \( x.  \)  However, in practice, it is common to use
  the expression \( f(x) \) to refer to both the function itself and
  its output for a given \( x, \) which is a slight deviation from
  strict notation.  Similarly, the function \( x \mapsto g(x) \) is
  often written as \( f(x) = g(x).  \)  For example, the function \( x
  \mapsto x^2 - 1 \) may also be written as \( f(x) = x^2 - 1.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Consider a function \( f \) that returns the square of a real
  number.  The following are common notations used to define this
  function, roughly ordered from the most formal form to the least
  formal one:

<h2 id="domain-codomain-and-image">Domain, Codomain and Image<a href="#domain-codomain-and-image"></a></h2>
<p>
  The <em>domain</em> of a function is the set of all values for which
  the function is defined.
</p>
<p>
  A <em>codomain</em> of a function \( f \) is a set within which the
  values \( f(x) \) for all \( x \in X \) must lie, where \( X \) is
  the domain of \( f.  \)
</p>
<p>
  The <em>image</em> of a function \( f \) is the set \( \{ f(x) \mid
  x \in X \} \) where \( X \) is the domain of \( f.  \)
</p>
<p>
  The term <em>range</em> is often used as a synonym of image.
  However the use of this term is inconsistent across literature.
  Some old books use the term range to mean codomain while other books
  use this term to mean the image.  Therefore it is best to use the
  term image because it is free from such ambiguity.
</p>
<h2 id="injection-surjection-and-bijection">Injection, Surjection and Bijection<a href="#injection-surjection-and-bijection"></a></h2>
<p>
  A function \( f : X \to Y \) is <em>injective</em> if \( \forall a,
  b \in X, a \neq b \implies f(a) \neq f(b).  \)  A function is
  injective, if each element of the codomain is mapped to by <em>at
  most</em> one element of the domain.  An injective function is also
  known as a <em>one-to-one</em> function or an injection.
</p>
<p>
  A function \( f : X \to Y \) is <em>surjective</em> if \( \forall y
  \in Y, \exists x \in X \) such that \( y = f(x).  \)  A function is
  surjective, if each element of the codomain is mapped to by <em>at
  least</em> one element of the domain.  A surjective function is also
  known as an <em>onto</em> function or a surjection.
</p>
<p>
  A function \( f : X \to Y \) is <em>bijective</em> if \( \forall y
  \in Y, \) there exists exactly one \( x \in X, \) such that \( y =
  f(x).  \)  A function is bijective, if each element of the codomain
  is mapped to by <em>exactly</em> one element of the domain.  A
  bijective function is also known as a <em>one-to-one
  correspondence</em> or bijection.  A bijection is both injective and
  surjective.  In other words, a bijection is both <em>one-to-one and
  onto</em>.
</p>
<p>
  The function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}; \; x \mapsto e^x \)
  is injective but not surjective.  It is injective because distinct
  values of \( x \) produce distinct values of \( e^x.  \)  However, it
  is not surjective as no value in the domain maps to negative numbers
  in the codomain, leaving some elements in the codomain unmapped.
</p>
<p>
  The function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}; \; x \mapsto x^3 - x \)
  is surjective but not injective.  It is surjective because every
  value in the codomain is mapped to by at least one value in the
  domain.  However, it is not injective, as distinct values in the
  domain can map to the same value in the codomain.  For example, \(
  f(-1) = f(0) = f(1) = 0.  \)
</p>
<p>
  The function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}; \; x \mapsto x + 1 \)
  is bijective.  It is both injective and surjective.  This function
  is invertible with the inverse given by the function \( x \mapsto x
  - 1.  \)
</p>
<p>
  The function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}; \; x \mapsto x^2 \)
  is neither injective nor surjective.  First, the function is not
  injective because distinct values in the domain can map to the same
  value in the codomain.  For example, \( f(-2) = f(2) = 4.  \)
  Additionally, the function is not surjective because no value in the
  domain maps to the negative numbers in the codomain.

  If you are not an active IRC user, prefer joining the Matrix channel
  because it is more convenient for someone unfamiliar with IRC.  For
  example, you can close your browser or client and your chat session
  will still stay alive on Matrix.  You can connect back the next day
  and catch up with the messages.  Doing that with IRC requires
  slightly more work such as setting up IRC bouncers etc.</small>

<p>
  The primary reference book for these meetings is
  <em>Real Analysis</em> written by the Scottish mathematician John
  Mackintosh Howie.
</p>
<p>
  These meetings are hosted by Susam and attended by some members of
  <code>##math</code> channel of Libera IRC network as well as by some
  members from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker

  You are welcome to join these meetings anytime.  If you are
  concerned that the meetings may not make sense if you join when we
  are in the middle of a chapter, please free to talk to us about it
  in the <a href="../#join">group channel</a>.  I can
  recommend the next best time to begin joining the meetings.
  Usually, it would be when we begin reading a new section or chapter
  that is fairly self-contained and does not depend a lot on material

    <p>
      This is a hobby club with a focus on mathematics and
      computation.  This club picks reading material about concepts
      and technologies that have been around for a long time and have
      an air of timelessness around them.  See the blog

      My name is Susam.  This is my website.  I run this club.  I host
      the book club meetings.  The last two series of book club
      meetings I hosted were about <a href="../iant/">analytic
      number theory</a> and <a href="../mastering-emacs/">Emacs</a>.
      Some members of Libera IRC network and Hacker News participated
      in those meetings.  This new series is going to be about real
      analysis.

    <p>
      We will discuss the content of the reference book.  This
      includes topics like sequences and series, functions and
      continuity, differentiation and integration, Taylor's theorem,
      the Riemann integral, etc.

    <p>
      The first series of book club meeting I organised focussed on
      the book <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written
      by Tom M. Apostol.  While the book excelled in rigour, some
      members, especially those without a strong mathematics
      background, found the constant alternation between theorems and
      proofs a bit too dry.  Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
      See <a href="../../journey-to-prime-number-theorem.html">Journey
      to Prime Number Theorem</a> for a related post.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the current series of meetings, I have chosen a more
      lightweight book that is easy to read.  Howie's relaxed writing
      style in this book seems enjoyable.  I do not know yet if this
      ease of reading comes at the cost of rigour.  I might be able to
      assess that better as we make more progress through this book.

  <li>
    <h3 id="have-you-read-the-book">Have you read the entire book?<a href="#have-you-read-the-book"></a></h3>
    <p>
      No, I have read the first few chapters of the book.  This means
      that I am a few chapters ahead of someone who has just begun
      reading this book, so I can maintain a steady pace in the club
      discussions and also be able to tell if some topics or areas of
      confusion in an earlier chapter will be clarified in a later
      chapter.

    <p>
      Not at all.  It is up to you, really.  If you would like to read
      the chapters in advance and come, that's great.  But it is not
      necessary.  We are going to discuss every page of the book in
      detail anyway.

  <li>
    <h3 id="can-i-lurk">Can I just lurk in the meetings?<a href="#can-i-lurk"></a></h3>
    <p>
      Yes!  Lurking is absolutely fine in our club meetings.  In fact,
      most members of the club join in and stay silent throughout the
      meetings.  Only a few members talk via audio/video or chat.
      This is considered absolutely normal in this club, so please do
      not hesitate to join our meetings!

<title>Perron's Paradox</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Oskar Perron, a German mathematician, introduced Perron's paradox to
  illustrate the danger of assuming the existence of a solution to an
  optimisation problem.  The paradox works like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  Let \( n \) be the largest positive integer.  Then either \( n =
  1 \) or \( n \gt 1.  \)  If \( n \gt 1, \) then \( n^2 \gt n, \)
  contradicting the definition of \( n.  \)  Hence \( n = 1.  \)
</div>
<p>
  We get this absurd result because of the incorrect assumption that
  there exists an integer that is the largest of all the integers.

<title>Logarithm Notation</title>

<p>
  We know that the natural logarithm of a number \( x, \) i.e. the
  logarithm of \( x \) to the base \( e, \) is sometimes denoted as \(
  \ln x.  \)  It has other notations too.  For example, many
  mathematics textbooks just use the notation \( \log x \) after
  establishing once that this notation denotes the natural logarithm.
  The most descriptive notation is perhaps \( \log_e x \) but this is
  most definitely an overkill.  I have never seen any serious textbook
  use this notation.
</p>
<p>
  Let us focus on \( \ln x \) again.  Is it not peculiar?  What does
  \( \ln \) stand for really?  Logarithm natural?  Sounds very unnatural.
</p>
<p>
  Well, as a kid I learnt that \( \ln \) here stands for the Latin
  phrase "logarithmus naturalis".  It is only recently that I bothered
  to verify if this expansion of \( \ln x \) that I learnt as a kid is
  really true.  The most credible discussion of this that I could find
  online is this thread on Mathematics Stack Exchange:
  <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1694">math.stackexchange.com/q/1694</a>.
  The answer by Dan Velleman points us to page 277 of an 1875
  book <em>Lehrbuch der Mathematik</em> by Anton Steinhauser.  Quoting
  the relevant portion from the page:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Man pflegt nun, um Verwechslungen dieser beiden Systeme vorzubeugen,
  mit log.nat. a (gesprochen: logarithmus naturalis a) oder ln. a,
  oder am einfachsten mit la den natürlichen, mit log.brigg. a
  (gesprochen: Logarithmus briggus a) oder log.a, oder am einfachsten
  mit lg. a den gemeinen Logarithmus (von a) zu bezeichnen.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Translated to English, it says:
</p>
<blockquote>
  One is accustomed now, in order to prevent confusion between these
  two systems, to use log.nat. a (pronounced: logarithmus naturalis a)
  or ln. a, or most simply la for the natural, and log.brigg. a
  (pronounced: logarithmus briggus a) or log. a, or most simply lg. a
  to denote the common logarithm (of a).
</blockquote>
<p>
  So it does look like what I learnt as a kid is correct and the
  earliest possible reference of this the Internet is able to find for
  us is the 1875 book quoted above.

  I recently came across a beautiful and thoughtful answer on
  MathOverflow by the late mathematician William Thurston.  A brief
  background about him from
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston">Wikipedia
  article</a> about him:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    William Paul Thurston (October 30, 1946 &ndash; August 21, 2012)
    was an American mathematician.  He was a pioneer in the field of
    low-dimensional topology and was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982
    for his contributions to the study of 3-manifolds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thurston was a professor of mathematics at Princeton University,
    University of California at Davis and Cornell University.  He was
    also a director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.
  </p>

  a Creative Commons licence.  In particular, all answers posted
  before 08 Apr 2011 (UTC) are available under the terms of the
  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Generic (CC BY-SA 2.5)
  licence.  Thurston wrote the answer I am about to share on 30 Oct
  2010.  Due to the licence terms, this post too is available under
  the terms of the same licence.
</p>
<p>
  Thurston posted his answer while replying to a MathOverflow
  question:
  <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/43690"><em>What's a
  mathematician to do?</em></a>.  The question enquires about how an
  ordinary mathematician can contribute to mathematics.  Thurston's
  answer
  from <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/44213">mathoverflow.net/a/44213</a>
  is reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It's not <em>mathematics</em> that you need to contribute to.
    It's deeper than that: how might you contribute to humanity, and
    even deeper, to the well-being of the world, by pursuing
    mathematics?  Such a question is not possible to answer in a
    purely intellectual way, because the effects of our actions go far
    beyond our understanding.  We are deeply social and deeply
    instinctual animals, so much that our well-being depends on many
    things we do that are hard to explain in an intellectual way.
    That is why you do well to follow your heart and your passion.
    Bare reason is likely to lead you astray.  None of us are smart
    and wise enough to figure it out intellectually.
  </p>
  <p>
    The product of mathematics is clarity and understanding.  Not
    theorems, by themselves.  Is there, for example any real reason
    that even such famous results as Fermat's Last Theorem, or the
    Poincar&eacute; conjecture, really matter?  Their real importance
    is not in their specific statements, but their role in challenging
    our understanding, presenting challenges that led to mathematical
    developments that increased our understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    The world does not suffer from an oversupply of clarity and
    understanding (to put it mildly).  How and whether specific
    mathematics might lead to improving the world (whatever that
    means) is usually impossible to tease out, but mathematics
    collectively is extremely important.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think of mathematics as having a large component of psychology,
    because of its strong dependence on human minds.  Dehumanized
    mathematics would be more like computer code, which is very
    different.  Mathematical ideas, even simple ideas, are often hard
    to transplant from mind to mind.  There are many ideas in
    mathematics that may be hard to get, but are easy once you get
    them.  Because of this, mathematical understanding does not expand
    in a monotone direction.  Our understanding frequently
    deteriorates as well.  There are several obvious mechanisms of
    decay.  The experts in a subject retire and die, or simply move on
    to other subjects and forget.  Mathematics is commonly explained
    and recorded in symbolic and concrete forms that are easy to
    communicate, rather than in conceptual forms that are easy to
    understand once communicated.  Translation in the direction
    conceptual -&gt; concrete and symbolic is much easier than
    translation in the reverse direction, and symbolic forms often
    replaces the conceptual forms of understanding.  And mathematical
    conventions and taken-for-granted knowledge change, so older texts
    may become hard to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, mathematics only exists in a living community of
    mathematicians that spreads understanding and breaths life into
    ideas both old and new.  The real satisfaction from mathematics is
    in learning from others and sharing with others.  All of us have
    clear understanding of a few things and murky concepts of many
    more.  There is no way to run out of ideas in need of
    clarification.  The question of who is the first person to ever
    set foot on some square meter of land is really secondary.
    Revolutionary change does matter, but revolutions are few, and
    they are not self-sustaining --- they depend very heavily on the
    community of mathematicians.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the comments to the answer, one of the commenters
  was <a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/">Suresh
  Venkatasubramanian</a> who was a professor in the School of
  Computing at the University of Utah back then.  He
  is <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/suresh">now</a> a
  professor of Computer Science and Data Science at Brown University.
  In his <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43690/whats-a-mathematician-to-do/44213#comment271029_44213">comment</a>,
  Suresh proposed that this answer be called <em>Thurston's
  Paean</em>.  Here is his complete comment:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This seems like an ideal counterpoint to Hardy's Lament.  I'm
    calling it Thurston's Paean :).  Seems poignant now that he has
    passed.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Thurston's answer does appear to be a perfect complement to Hardy's
  lament in the 1940 essay <em>A Mathematician's Apology</em>.  While
  Hardy's lament is remarkably beautiful and introspective, it may
  also feel a little depressing at places.  Thurston's post on the
  other hand is full of hope and purpose that goes beyond the actual
  work of doing mathematics.  Indeed <em>Thurston's Paean</em> is a
  befitting title for his answer.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>
  One of the many techniques for solving ordinary differential
  equations involves using an <em>integrating factor</em>.  An
  integrating factor is a function that a differential equation is
  multiplied by to simplify it and make it integrable.  It almost
  appears to work like magic!
</p>
<h2 id="method">The Method<a href="#method"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us first see how the integrating factor method works.  In this

  equations of type

    \frac{dy}{dx} + y P(x) = Q(x)
  \]

  to discuss, reason about and illustrate this method.  We will also
  often use the Leibniz's notation \( dy/dx \) and the Lagrange's
  notation \( y'(x) \) or simply \( y' \) interchangeably as is
  typical in calculus.  They all mean the same thing: the derivative
  of the function \( y \) with respect to \( x.  \)  Thus the above
  differential equation may also be written as

  \[
    y' + y P(x) = Q(x).
  \]

  Given a differential equation of this form, we first find an
  integrating factor \( M(x) \) using the formula

  \[
    M(x) = e^{\int P(x) \, dx}.
  \]

  Then we multiply both sides of the differential equation by this
  integrating factor.  Now remarkably, the left-hand side (LHS)
  reduces to a single term consisting only of a derivative.  As a
  result, we can get rid of that derivative by integrating both sides
  of the equation and we then proceed to obtain a solution.
</p>
<h2 id="example">An Example<a href="#example"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here is an example that demonstrates the method of using an
  integrating factor.  Let us say we want to solve the differential
  equation

  \[
    y' + y \left( \frac{x + 1}{x} \right) = \frac{1}{x}.
  \]

  Indeed this is in the form \( y' + y P(x) = Q(x) \) with \( P(x) =
  (x + 1)/x \) and \( Q(x) = 1/x.  \)  We first obtain the integrating
  factor

  \[
    M(x)
    = e^{\int P(x) \, dx}
    = e^{\int (x + 1)/x \, dx}
    = e^{\int (1 + 1/x) \, dx}
    = e^{x + \ln x}
    = x e^x.
  \]

  Now we multiply both sides of the differential equation by this
  integrating factor and get

  \[
    y' x e^x + y (x + 1) e^x = e^x.
  \]

  The LHS can now be simplified to \( \frac{d}{dx} (y x e^x).  \)  This
  can be verified using the product rule for derivatives.  This
  simplification of the LHS is the remarkable feature of this method.
  Therefore the above equation can be written as

  \[
    \frac{d}{dx} (y x e^x) = e^x.
  \]

  Note that the expression on the LHS is a product of the function \(
  y \) and the integrating factor \( x e^x.  \)  We will discuss this
  observation in more detail a little later.  Let us first complete
  solving this differential equation.  Since the LHS is now a single
  term that consists of a derivative, obtaining a solution now simply
  involves integrating both sides with respect to \( x.  \)
  Integrating both sides we get

  \[
    y x e^x = e^x + C
  \]

  where \( C \) is the constant of integration.  Finally, we divide
  both sides by the integrating factor \( x e^x \) to get

  \[
    y = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{C}{x e^x}.
  \]

  We have now obtained a solution for the differential equation.  If
  we review the steps above, we will find that after multiplying both
  sides of the given differential equation by the integrating factor,
  the differential equation becomes significantly simpler and
  integrable.  In fact, after multiplying both sides of the given
  differential equation by the integrating factor, the LHS always
  becomes the derivative of the product of the function \( y \) and
  the integrating factor.  We will now see why this is so.
</p>
<h2 id="interesting-relationship">An Interesting Relationship<a href="#interesting-relationship"></a></h2>
<p>
  Consider once again the linear first-order differential equation

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq-if-diff}
    y' + yP(x) = Q(x).
  \end{equation}

  We first find the integrating factor

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq-if-integrating-factor}
    M(x) = e^{\int P(x)\, dx}.
  \end{equation}

  The integrating factor obtained like this satisfies an interesting
  relationship:

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq-if-property}
    M'(x) = M(x) P(x).
  \end{equation}

  We can prove this relationship easily by differentiating both sides
  of \( \eqnref{eq-if-integrating-factor}{2} \) as follows:

  \[
    M'(x)
    = \frac{d}{dx} \left( e^{\int P(x)\, dx} \right)
    = e^{\int P(x)\, dx} \frac{d}{dx} \left( \int P(x)\, dx \right)
    = M(x) P(x).
  \]

  Note that we use the chain rule to work out the derivative above.
  This beautiful result is due to how the derivative of the
  exponential function works.  When we apply the chain rule to obtain
  the derivative of \( e^{f(x)} \) we get

  \[
    \frac{d}{dx} e^{f(x)} = e^{f(x)} f'(x).
  \]

  This nice property of the exponential function leads to the
  interesting relationship in \( \eqnref{eq-if-property}{3}.  \)
</p>
<h2 id="simplification-of-lhs">Simplification of LHS<a href="#simplification-of-lhs"></a></h2>
<p>
  Now let us multiply both sides of the differential equation \(
  \eqnref{eq-if-diff}{1} \) by the integrating factor \( M(x) \) By
  doing so, we get

  \[
    y' M(x) + y P(x) M(x) = Q(x) M(x).
  \]

  But from \( \eqnref{eq-if-property}{3} \) we know that \( P(x) M(x)
  = M'(x), \) so the above equation can be written as

  \[
    y' M(x) + y M'(x) = Q(x) M(x).
  \]

  Look what we have got on the LHS!  We have the expansion of \(
  \frac{d}{dx}(yM(x)) \) on the LHS.  By product rule of
  differentiation, we have
  \( \frac{d}{dx}(yM(x)) = y' M(x) + y M'(x).  \)  Therefore the above
  equation can be written as

  \[
    \frac{d}{dx}(yM(x)) = Q(x) M(x).
  \]

  The "magic" has occurred here!  Multiplying both sides of the
  differential equation by the integrating factor has led us to an
  equation that has got a single derivative only on the LHS.  As a
  result, finding the solution is now a simple matter of integrating
  both sides, i.e.

  \[
    y M(x) = \int Q(x) M(x) \, dx.
  \]

  Thus

  \[
    y = \frac{1}{M(x)} \int Q(x) M(x) \, dx.
  \]

  Note that the result of indefinite integral on the RHS will contain
  the constant of integration, which we will denote as \( C, \) so the
  final solution looks like

  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq-if-general-solution}
    y = \frac{1}{M(x)} \int Q(x) M(x) \, dx + \frac{C}{M(x)}.
  \end{equation}
</p>
<h2 id="illustration">Illustration<a href="#illustration"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us illustrate the method and its magic with a very simple
  differential equation:

  \[
    y' + \frac{y}{x} = x.
  \]

  First we note that this equation is in the form
  \( y' + yP(x) = Q(x) \) with \( P(x) = 1/x \) and \( Q(x) = x.  \)
  We then find the integrating factor

  \[
  M(x)
  = e^{\int P(x) \, dx}
  = e^{\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx}
  = e^{\ln x}
  = x.
  \]

  Then we multiply both sides of the differential equation by the
  integrating factor to get

  \[
    y'x + y = x^2.
  \]

  Now indeed the LHS can be written down as a single derivative as
  shown below:

  \[
    \frac{d}{dx} yx = x^2.
  \]

  Note that the LHS is the derivative of the product of \( y \) and
  the integrating factor \( x.  \)  This is exactly what we discussed
  in the previous section.  We integrate both sides of the above
  equation to get

  \[
    yx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C.
  \]

  Finally we divide both sides by the integrating factor \( x \) to
  get

  \[
    y = \frac{x^2}{3} + \frac{C}{x}.
  \]

  We have arrived at the solution \( y(x) \) for the differential
  equation.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  In this post, we used very simple and convenient differential
  equations that led to nice closed-form solutions.  In practice,
  differential equations can be quite complicated and may not always
  lead to closed-form solutions.  In such cases, we leave the result
  in the form of an expression that contains an unsolved integral.
  Such solutions may resemble the form shown in
  \( \eqnref{eq-if-general-solution}{4}.  \)
</p>
<p>
  The method of using integrating factors to solve differential
  equations can also be extended to linear higher-order differential
  equations.  That is something we did not discuss in this post.
  However, I hope that the intuition gained from understanding how and
  why this method works for linear first-order differential equations
  will be useful while studying such extensions of this method.

<title>GCD Grid</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
  I recently completed reading the book <em>Introduction to Analytic
  Number Theory</em> written by Tom M. Apostol and published in 1976.
  It is a fantastic book that takes us through a breathtaking journey
  of analytic number theory.  The journey begins with simple
  properties of divisibility and ends with integer partitions.  During
  this journey, we learn about several fascinating concepts such as
  the M&ouml;bius function, Dirichlet multiplication, Chebyshev's
  functions, Dirichlet characters, quadratic residues, the Riemann
  zeta function, etc.  An analytic proof of the prime number theorem
  is also presented in the book.
</p>
<p>
  One of the things about the book that caught my interest from the
  very beginning was its front cover.  It has a peculiarly drawn grid
  of white boxes and red empty regions that looks quite interesting.
  Here is the grid from the front cover of the book:
</p>
<figure>
  <a href="files/blog/iant-cover.png"><img
      src="files/blog/iant-cover.png"
      alt="A diagram of a grid with cells and empty region"></a>
  <figcaption>
    Diagram of a grid on the front cover of the book <em>Introduction
    to Analytic Number Theory</em>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Can we come up with a simple and elegant rule that defines this
  grid?  Here is one I could come up with:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <em>
    Number the columns in the grid 0, 1, 2 and so on from left to
    right.  Number the rows in the grid 0, 1, 2 and so on from bottom
    to top.  Let \( (x, y) \) represent the cell at column \( x \) and
    row \( y.  \)  Then a box exists at \( (x, y) \) if and only if \(
    \gcd(x, y) \ne 1.  \)
  </em>
</div>
<p>
  We define \( \gcd(x, y) \) to be a nonnegative common divisor of \(
  x \) and \( y \) such that every common divisor of \( x \) and
  \( y \) also divides \( \gcd(x, y).  \)  Let us now see if we can
  explain some of the interesting properties of this grid using the
  above rule:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      When \( x = 0 \) and \( y \ne 1, \) we get \( \gcd(x, y) =
      \lvert y \rvert \ne 1, \) so the entire column at \( x = 0 \)
      has boxes except at \( (0, 1).  \)  Similarly, the entire row at
      \( y = 0 \) has boxes except at \( (1, 0).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The cell \( (0, 0) \) has a box because \( \gcd(0, 0) \ne 1.  \)
      In fact, \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0.  \)  This follows from the definition
      of the \( \gcd \) function.  We will discuss this in more detail
      later in this post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every diagonal cell \( (x, x) \) has a box except at
      \( (1, 1) \) because \( \gcd(x, x) = \lvert x \rvert \) for all
      integers \( x.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The grid is symmetric about the diagonal cells \( (x, x) \)
      because \( \gcd(x, y) = \gcd(y, x).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A column at \( x \) has exactly one cell below the diagonal if
      and only if \( x \) is prime.  For example, check the column for
      \( x = 5.  \)  It has exactly one cell below the diagonal.  We
      know that \( 5 \) is prime.  Now check the column for
      \( x = 6.  \)  It has four cells below the diagonal.  We know
      that \( 6 \) is not prime.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Let us now elaborate the second point in the list above.  If \(
  \gcd(0, 0) \) is \( 0, \) then \( 0 \) must divide \( 0.  \)  Does \(
  0 \) really divide \( 0?  \)  Isn't \( 0/0 \) undefined?  Yes, even
  though \( 0/0 \) is undefined, \( 0 \) divides \( 0.  \)  We say an
  integer \( d \) divides an integer \( n \) when \( n = cd \) for
  some integer \( c.  \)  We have \( 0 = 0 \cdot 0, \) so indeed
  \( 0 \) divides \( 0.  \)
</p>
<p>
  We have shown that \( 0 \) divides \( 0 \) but we have not shown yet
  that \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0.  \)  Is \( \gcd(0, 0) \) really \( 0?  \)
  Every integer divides \( 0, \) e.g. \( 1 \) divdes \( 0, \) \( 2 \)
  divides \( 0, \) \( 3 \) divides \( 0, \) etc.  There does not seem
  to be a greatest common divisor of \( 0 \) and \( 0.  \)  Shouldn't
  \( \gcd(0, 0) \) be called either infinity or undefined?  No, we
  need to look at the definition of \( \gcd \) introduced earlier.  As
  per the definition, every common divisor of integers \( x \) and \(
  y \) must also divide \( \gcd(x, y).  \)  With this requirement in
  mind, we see that \( \gcd(0, 0) \) must be \( 0.  \)  This definition
  also makes \( \gcd(n, 0) = \gcd(0, n) = \lvert n \rvert \) for all
  integers \( n.  \)  Further, this definition makes B&eacute;zout's
  identity hold for all integers.  B&eacute;zout's identity states
  that there exists integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( mx + ny
  = \gcd(x, y).  \)  Indeed if we have \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0, \) we get \(
  0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0 = 0 = \gcd(0, 0).  \)
</p>
<p>
  That's all I wanted to share about the front cover of the book.
  While the front cover is quite interesting, the content of the book
  is even more fascinating.  I found chapters 12 and 13 of the book to
  be the most interesting.  In chapter 12, the book teaches how to
  prove that the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \) vanishes at
  every negative even integer \( s.  \)  Through several contour
  integrals and clever use of Cauchy's residue theorem, it shows in
  the end that \( \zeta(-2n) = 0 \) for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \dots.  \)  In
  chapter 13, the book shows us how to obtain zero-free regions where
  \( \zeta(s) \) does not vanish.  The book exposes various subtle
  nuances of the zeta function with great rigour and thoroughness.
  Results like \( \zeta(-1) = -1/12 \) that once felt mysterious look
  crystal clear and obvious after working through this book.  I
  strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn analytic
  number theory.

<title>Final IANT Meeting Today</title>

<![CDATA[
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>
  We have been reading the book <em>Introduction to Analytic Number
  Theory</em> by Apostol (1976) since March 2021.  It has been going
  consistently since then and the previous few posts on this blog
  provide an account of how this journey has been so far.  After about
  seven months of reading this book together, we are having our final
  meeting for this book today.  This is going to be
  the <a href="cc/iant/log.html#120">120th meeting</a> of our book
  discussion group.  The meeting notes from all previous reading
  sessions are archived at
  <a href="cc/iant/">IANT Notes</a>.  We will discuss the
  final two pages of this book today and complete reading this book.
</p>
<p>
  In the meeting today, we will look at some applications of the
  recursion formula related to partition functions that we learnt
  earlier.  Here is an excerpt from the book that shows a specific
  example that demonstrates the richness and beauty of concepts one
  can discover while studying analytic number theory:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Equation (24) becomes

  \[
  np(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma(k) p(n - k).
  \]

  a remarkable relation connecting a function of multiplicative number
  theory with one of additive number theory.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Now what equation (24) contains is not important for this post.  Of
  course, you can refer to the book if you really want to know what
  equation (24) is.  We learnt to prove that equation in the
  penultimate meeting for this subject yesterday.  In this post, I
  will emphasise how indeed this equation is remarkable.
</p>

  <li><a href="#thanks">Thanks!</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="divisor-sum-function">The Divisor Sum Function<a href="#divisor-sum-function"></a></h2>
<p>
  The divisor sum function \( \sigma(n) \) represents the sum of all
  positive divisors of \( n.  \)  Here are some examples:

  \begin{align*}
  \sigma(1) &amp;= 1, \\
  \sigma(2) &amp;= 1 + 2 = 3, \\
  \sigma(3) &amp;= 1 + 3 = 4, \\
  \sigma(4) &amp;= 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, \\
  \sigma(5) &amp;= 1 + 5 = 6.
  \end{align*}

  We have spent a good amount of time with this function in the
  initial chapters of the book.  However, for the purpose of this blog
  post, the definition and the examples above are good enough.
</p>
<h2 id="unrestricted-partition-function">The Unrestricted Partition Function<a href="#unrestricted-partition-function"></a></h2>
<p>
  The \( p(n) \) function is the unrestricted partition function.  It
  represents the number of ways \( n \) can be written as a sum of
  positive integers \( \le n.  \)  Further, we let \( p(0) = 1.  \)
  Here are some examples:

  \begin{align*}
  p(1) &amp;= 1, \\
  p(2) &amp;= 2, \\
  p(3) &amp;= 3, \\
  p(4) &amp;= 4, \\
  p(5) &amp;= 7.
  \end{align*}

  Let me illustration the last value.  The integer \( 5 \) can be
  represented as a sum of positive integers \( \le 5 \) in 7 different
  ways.  They are: \( 5, \) \( 4 + 1, \) \( 3 + 2, \) \( 3 + 1 + 1, \)
  \( 2 + 2 + 1, \) \( 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 \) and \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.  \)
  Thus \( p(n) = 5.  \)
</p>
<h2 id="linkage-of-two-theorems">The Linkage of Two Theories<a href="#linkage-of-two-theorems"></a></h2>
<p>
  The divisor sum function comes from multiplicative number theory.
  The partition function comes from additive number theory.  Yet these
  two very different things get linked together in the formula
  mentioned in the excerpt included above.  Here is the formula once
  again:

  \[
    np(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma(k) p(n - k).
  \]

  How beautiful!  How nicely the divisor sum function and the
  unrestricted partition function appear together elegantly in a
  single equation!  Further, this equation provides a recursion
  formula for the partition function.

  Here is an illustration of this equation with \( n = 5 \):

  \[
    5 \cdot p(5) = 5 \cdot 7 = 35.
  \]

  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^5 \sigma(k) p(5 - k)
    &amp;= \sigma(1) p(4) + \sigma(2) p(3) + \sigma(3) p(2) + \sigma(4) p(1) + \sigma(5) p(0) \\
    &amp;= (1)(5) + (3)(3) + (4)(2) + (7)(1) + (6)(1) \\
    &amp;= 5 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 \\
    &amp;= 35.
  \end{align*}

  We will go through this topic once more in the meeting today, so if
  you are interested to see this formula worked out in a step-by-step
  manner, do join our final meeting for this book.
</p>
<h2 id="final-meeting">The Final Meeting<a href="#final-meeting"></a></h2>
<p>
  The final meeting is coming up at 17:00 UTC today.  Visit
  the <a href="cc/iant/">analytic number theory page</a> to
  get the meeting link.  This is not going to be the final meeting for
  our overall book discussion group though.  This is going to be the
  finally meeting for only the analytic number theory book.  We will
  have more meetings for another book after a short break.
</p>
<p>
  The meeting today is going to be a lightweight session.  The last
  two pages that we will discuss today contain some examples of
  recursion formulas and some commentary about Ramanujan's partition
  identities.  Most of it should make sense even to those who have not
  been part of our meetings earlier, so everyone is welcome to join
  this meeting today, even if only to lurk.  You can also join our
  group by joining our IRC channel where we will publish updates about
  future meetings.  Our channel details are available in the
  <a href="cc/#join">main page here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks!<a href="#thanks"></a></h2>
<p>
  A big thank you to the Hacker News community and the Libera IRC
  mathematics and algorithms communities who showed interest in these
  meetings, joined the meetings and made this series of meetings
  successful.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>
  After <a href="cc/iant/log.html#114">114 meetings</a> and 75 hours
  of studying together, our analytic number theory book discussion
  group has finally reached the final chapter of the
  book <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> by Apostol
  (1976).  We have less than 18 pages to read in order to complete
  reading this book.  Considering that we meet 3-4 times in a week and
  we discuss about 2-3 pages in every meeting, it appears that we
  would be able to complete reading this book in another 2 weeks.
</p>
<p>
  Reading this book has been quite a journey!  The previous three
  posts on this blog provide an account of how this journey has been.
  It has been fun, of course.  The best part of hosting a book
  discussion group like this has been the number of extremely smart
  people I got an opportunity to meet and interact with.  The insights
  and comments on the study material that others shared during the
  meetings were very helpful.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="cc/iant/log.html">meeting log</a> shows that our
  meetings started really small with only 4 participants in the first
  meeting in March 2021 and then it gradually grew to about 10-12
  regular members within a month.  Then a few months later, the number
  of participants began dwindling a little.  This happened because
  some members of the group had to drop out as they got busy with
  other personal or professional engagements.  However, six months
  later, we still have about 4-5 regular participants meeting
  consistently.  I think it is pretty good that we have made it this
  far.

  The final chapter on integer partitions is very unlike all the
  previous 12 chapters.  While the previous chapters dealt
  with <em>multiplicative number theory</em>, this final chapter deals
  with <em>additive number theory</em>.  For example, the first
  theorem talks about an interesting property of <em>unrestricted
  partitions</em>.  We study the number of ways a positive integer can
  be expressed as a sum of positive integers.  The number of summands
  is unrestricted, repetition of summands is allowed and the order of
  the summands is not taken into account.  For example, the number 3
  has 3 partitions: 3, 2 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1.  Similarly, the number 4
  has 5 partitions: 4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

  I have always wanted to learn about partitions more deeply, so I am
  quite happy that this book ends with a chapter on partitions.  The
  subject of partitions is rich with very interesting results obtained
  by various accomplished mathematicians.  In the book, the first
  theorem about partitions is a very simple one that follows from the
  geometric representation of partitions.  Let us see an illustration
  first.
</p>
<p>
  How many partitions of 6 are there?  There are 11 partitions of 6.
  They are 6, 5 + 1, 4 + 2, 4 + 1 + 1, 3 + 3, 3 + 2 + 1, 3 + 1 + 1 +
  1, 2 + 2 + 2, 2 + 2 + 1 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
  + 1.  Now how many of these partitions are made up of 5 parts?  Each
  summand is called a part.  The answer is 2.  There are 2 partitions
  of 6 that are made up of 5 parts.  They are 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 2 + 2
  + 1 + 1.  Let us represent both these partitions as arrangements of
  lattice points.  Here is the representation of the partition 3 + 1 +
  1 + 1:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&bull; &bull; &bull;
&bull;
&bull;
&bull;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now if we read this arrangement from left to right, column by
  column, we get another partition of 6, i.e. 4 + 1 + 1.  Note that
  the number of parts in 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 (i.e. 4) appears as the largest
  part in 4 + 1 + 1.  Similarly, the number of parts in 4 + 1 + 1
  (i.e. 3) appears as the largest part in 3 + 1 + 1 + 1.  Let us see
  one more example of this relationship.  Here is the geometric
  representation of 2 + 2 + 1 + 1:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&bull; &bull;
&bull; &bull;
&bull;
&bull;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Once again, reading this representation from left to right, we get 4
  + 2, another partition of 6.  Once again, we can see that the number
  of partitions in 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 (i.e. 4) appears as the largest part
  in 4 + 2 and vice versa.  These observations lead to the first
  theorem in the chapter on partitions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Theorem 14.1</strong>
  <em>
    The number ofpartitions of \( n \)
    into \( m \) parts is equal to the number of partitions of \( n \)
    into parts, the largest of which is \( m.  \)
  </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
  That was a brief introduction to the chapter on partitions.  In the
  next two or so weeks, we will dive deeper into the theory of
  partitions.

  If this blog post was fun for you, consider joining our next
  meeting.  Our next meeting is on Tue, 21 Sep 2021 at 17:00 UTC.
  Since we are at the beginning of a new chapter, it is a good time
  for new participants to join us.  It is also a good time for members
  who have been away for a while to join us back.  Since this chapter
  does not depend much on the previous chapters, new participants
  should be able to join our reading sessions for this chapter and
  follow along easily without too much effort.

  It is worth mentioning here that lurking is absolutely fine in our
  meetings.  In fact, most participants of our meetings join in and
  stay silent throughout the meeting.  Only a few members talk via
  audio/video or chat.  This is considered absolutely normal in our
  meetings, so please do not hesitate to join our meetings!
