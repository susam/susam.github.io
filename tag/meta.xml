<h1>Colophon</h1>
<p>
  Here are some details about how this website is maintained and
  published:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website runs on a <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> system.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website is served
      using <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/nginx">Nginx</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website is generated statically using a small
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/main/site.lisp">Common
        Lisp program</a>.  This program is available under the terms of
      the MIT license.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every line of HTML and CSS that makes this website is
      handcrafted.  The final HTML pages, however, are generated using
      a Common Lisp program.  This program merely combines the
      handcrafted HTML content with a handcrafted HTML layout to
      generate the pages that are served over the web.  The content
      HTML, layout HTML and the Common Lisp program were all written
      from scratch.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All web pages on this website are
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/08a2d7b/Makefile#L372-L377">validated
      using HTML Tidy</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      While most of this website is made of static HTML pages served
      via Nginx, the pages for the comment and subscriber forms are
      dynamic in nature.  They are implemented using Common Lisp and
      Hunchentoot.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website has a <a href="pages.html">site-wide page list</a>
      that includes every page on this website.  It doesn't matter if
      the page is part of a blog, a standalone HTML tool or an HTML
      game.  Every single web page on this website occurs in this
      list.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website has a <a href="links.html">links page</a> that has
      pointers to various sections of my website.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website has a <a href="tag/">tag list page</a>
      that can be used to browse this website by topics.  Clicking on
      any tag on the tag list page, presents a list of all web pages
      that have been marked with that tag.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website provides a consolidated <a href="feed.xml">web feed
      (RSS)</a>.  The Common Lisp program mentioned earlier ensures
      that every new web page that appears on this website also
      appears in this web feed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every tag has its own web feed.  For example,
      see <a href="tag/technology.html">tag/technology.html</a> for a
      list of all pages tagged "Technology" and then
      see <a href="tag/technology.xml">tag/technology.xml</a> for the
      corresponding web feed.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The web feeds are sparingly styled with
      <a href="feed.xsl">XSLT</a>.  Web browsers that support XSL
      transformation for web feeds render the feeds as HTML (rather
      than raw XML) as determined by the stylesheet.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website has an old-fashioned
      <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a>.  Feel free to leave a
      message there if you would like to say hello or share a thought.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website includes a <a href="roll.html">blogroll</a>
      generated by a small Common Lisp program.  It reads the RSS and
      Atom feeds of my favourite blogs and generates a page with links
      to recent entries.  This has turned out to be a pleasant and
      effective way to keep up with my feeds, so much so that I no
      longer use any dedicated feed reader software or aggregator
      services.  See also: <a href="blogroll-as-feed-reader.html">My
      Blogroll Is My Feed Reader</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every directory and subdirectory on this website has a directory
      listing page that lists all its files and subdirectories.
      See <a href="ls.html">ls.html</a> for an example.  Subdirectory
      names are marked with a trailing slash.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website loads KaTeX to render LaTeX snippets on web pages
      that contain mathematical formulas.  For example, see the page
      <a href="integrating-factor.html">integrating-factor.html</a>.
      KaTeX is not loaded on other web pages.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All internal links on this website are relative links.  In fact,
      all internal resources like the stylesheet, KaTeX, etc. too are
      loaded using relative links.  Doing so allows me to browse this
      website locally from my local drive without having to run a web
      server on my development system.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    All web pages on this website have been
    <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/0.3.0/Makefile#L486-L490">validated
    to ensure that there are no broken internal links</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      When you visit any web page on this website, all resources are
      loaded from this website and only this website.  No external
      resources are loaded.  This ensures that when you visit this
      website, no data about your client is transmitted to another web
      server.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website does not load analytics scripts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      This website does not use cookies.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

      website.  This text submitted by you may contain your name, a
      URL to your profile on the world wide web and a comment.  This
      text is written by you, so you are in complete control of what

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      HTTP referrer URL sent by your web browser or client software
      while connecting to this website.  A web browser or a client
      software typically, but not necessarily, sends the URL of the
      web page or website where you clicked on a link to visit this
      website as the HTTP referrer value.  If this website is visited
      directly without clicking on any link, then a web browser or
      client does not typically send any HTTP referrer data.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      User agent string sent by your web browser or client software
      while visiting this website.  A web browser or a client software
      typically, but not necessarily, includes the names and versions
      of your device and operating system as well as the name and
      version of your web browser or client software in the user agent
      string.

  submission fails due to errors, then your text is neither saved nor
  published.  If the comment submission succeeds, the text submitted
  by you is reviewed within 30 days.  If your comment is found to be
  suitable for this website, then the text you have submitted is
  published on the website.  If the comment is found to be unsuitable
  for this website, then the text file containing your submitted text
  is deleted.
</p>
<p>
  When you submit a new subscribe or unsubscribe request to this
  website successfully, your email address is written to a file on the
  web server.  If the request submission fails due to errors, then

  Google Groups mailing list that is used to send email newsletters.
  The use of your email address by Google Groups is covered by
  Google's privacy policy.
</p>
<h2 id="data-usage">Data Usage<a href="#data-usage"></a></h2>
<p>
  The IP address, referrer data and user agent string is used to
  monitor abuse of this website such as submitting spam comments,
  sending too many requests to reduce the availability of this
  website, etc.  This data is also used to mitigate abuse of this
  website by blocking certain combinations of IP address, referrer
  data and/or user agent from accessing this website or by limiting
  the number of requests such a combination may send to this website.
</p>
<p>

  comment is found to be suitable for this website during review, the
  comment text is published at a comments page on this website.

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi!  I am Susam Pal.  Welcome to my website.  This page provides a
  brief introduction about me and this website.
</p>
<p>
  I am a software engineer by profession.  I have a keen interest in
  free and open source software.  My first non-trivial contribution to
  open source was
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">NUTCH-559</a>
  in 2007.  That contribution added support for various authentication
  schemes to Apache Nutch, an open source web crawler.  I have
  remained active in the open source communities since then.  I also
  develop and maintain a few open source projects of my own at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam">github.com/susam</a>.  For a list
  of my projects, see my <a href="foss.html">open source work
  details</a>.
</p>
<p>
  When not involved with technology, I like reading books, playing the
  piano and travelling.
</p>
<h2 id="irc">IRC<a href="#irc"></a></h2>
<p>
  I am usually online as my IRC nick <em>susam</em> on
  <a href="https://web.libera.chat/">Libera IRC</a>.  I hang out at
  various channels like #algorithms, #commonlisp, #emacs, #python,
  etc.
</p>
<p>
  The #algorithms channel was founded by me first on Freenode in 2007
  when there was no such channel dedicated to the subject of
  algorithms.  It started as a tiny community of about 10 members from
  the ##math channel and then gradually grew to have over 200 members
  within a few years.  The channel was then
  <a href="algorithms-channel-migrates-to-libera-chat.html">migrated</a>
  to Libera in 2021.
</p>
<h2 id="website">Website<a href="#website"></a></h2>
<p>
  This website is generated using a Common Lisp program.  Most of this
  website is static in nature.  The
  <a href="form/comment/?p=about">comment form</a> on this
  website is served dynamically using a tiny web server program
  written in Common Lisp.  See
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net">github.com/susam/susam.net</a>
  for the source code of this website.
</p>
<p>
  Every line of HTML and CSS that makes this website is handcrafted.
  See <a href="colophon.html">colophon.html</a> for more details about
  how this website is written and run.
</p>
<p>
  The primary copy of this website is hosted at
  <a href="https://susam.net/">susam.net</a>.  A mirror of the
  website is hosted at
  <a href="https://susam.github.io/">susam.github.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This website began its life as an intranet portal running on an
  intranet server out of my dorm room during my university days back
  in 2001-2005.  That intranet server was named <code>maze</code>.  I
  used to run that server for my fellow students in our university's
  computer network.  The server used to host an FTP server and an HTTP
  portal for mathematical puzzles, technical articles, free software
  downloads and audio/video streaming.  While that intranet portal and
  its source code written in Classic ASP are now long gone, some of
  its content still survives on this website.
</p>
<h2 id="browse">Browse<a href="#browse"></a></h2>
<p>
  The <a href="./">home page</a> of this website presents
  my primary blog.  I write about technology, mathematics and other
  miscellaneous topics on this blog.  The posts on my primary blog
  often tend to be long-form, involved and detailed.  They sometimes
  take considerable time to write and publish.  As a result, the
  interval between two posts on this blog can range from several weeks
  to months.
</p>
<p>
  I also archive notes, code and various miscellaneous files on other
  sections of this website that I update more frequently than my
  primary blog.  Visit <a href="links.html">links.html</a> to find
  quick links to my primary blog as well as other sections of this
  website.
</p>
<h2 id="guestbook">Guestbook<a href="#guestbook"></a></h2>
<p>
  This website has a simple, old-fashioned guestbook.  Please
  visit <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook.html</a> if you would like
  to leave a comment.
</p>
<h2 id="blogroll">Blogroll<a href="#blogroll"></a></h2>
<p>
  This website has a blogroll.  On a particularly hot summer day in
  June 2025, with temperatures soaring to 31&nbsp;&deg;C, I decided to
  write a small Common Lisp program that generates a page with links
  to recent entries from my favourite blogs.  To check my blogroll,
  please visit <a href="roll.html">roll.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I have found this to be a great way to keep up with my feeds.
  Thanks to this section of my website, I no longer use feed readers
  or aggregators.  I could never quite make a habit of using them
  regularly anyway.
</p>
<p>
  Credit for this nifty and very effective idea of using my blogroll
  as my feed reader goes to Alex Kladov!  It was Alex's
  website, <a href="https://matklad.github.io/">matklad.github.io</a>,
  that inspired me to implement <a href="roll.html">my own
  blogroll</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="colours">Colours<a href="#colours"></a></h2>
<p>
  This website supports both light and dark colour schemes.  The
  information box below shows the colour scheme selected right now.
</p>
<p class="light highlight">
  The <strong>light colour scheme</strong> is active currently.
</p>
<p class="dark highlight">
  The <strong>dark colour scheme</strong> is active currently.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to browse this website using the opposite colour
  scheme, please check if your operating system or web browser
  supports changing the preferred colour scheme.  Most modern
  operating systems do support it.
</p>
<h2 id="name">Name<a href="#name"></a></h2>
<p>
  I have been told many times that my name, <em>"Susam"</em>, is a
  little unusual which makes it difficult for others to figure how to
  pronounce it.  It is pronounced almost like the English
  words <em>"sue sum"</em> (/suːsʌm/).  However you may call my name
  however you find most natural, convenient or intuitive.  I do not
  mind mispronunciations of my name at all whatsoever.
</p>

  If you find any bugs, typos or errors on this website, please report
  them to me by <a href="form/comment/?p=bug">sending a
  comment</a>.
