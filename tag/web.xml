<title>QuickQWERTY 1.2.0</title>

<p>
  QuickQWERTY 1.2.0 is now available.  QuickQWERTY is a web-based
  touch typing tutor for QWERTY keyboards that runs directly in the
  web browser.
</p>
<p>
  This release brings small improvements to make the typing tutor
  smoother and the lessons more accurate.  When you return to the
  application, it no longer needlessly redirects you back to Unit 1.1
  if that was the last lesson you practised.
</p>
<p>
  Several lessons have received minor corrections.  Units 7.2 and 7.3
  no longer include the word "tyre", avoiding a preference for either
  British or American spelling.  Units 9.2 and 9.3 now spell
  "orwellian" correctly.  A factual error in Unit 17.4 has been fixed
  too.  It previously said "89 is one more than 99", which now
  correctly reads "89 is one more than 88".
</p>
<p>
  Finally, switching between the 5-6 and 6-7 split layouts is now more
  reliable.  In the previous release, pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> to
  cancel the confirmation dialogue still caused the switch to go
  through.  Now pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> properly cancels the switch as
  expected.
</p>
<p>
  To try out the new release of QuickQWERTY, go to

<title>I Reinstated My Guestbook After 20 Years</title>
<link>https://susam.net/reinstated-guestbook.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">gbret</guid>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  I have reinstated the <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a> on this
  website after 20 years!  As I have written in the
  <a href="about.html">About</a> page, this website began its life as
  an intranet portal in my university network back in 2001â€“2005.  That
  portal first ran on Microsoft Personal Web Server (PWS) and later on
  Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), with the guestbook
  data stored in a Microsoft Access database.  At the same time, I
  also maintained a small public website on the Internet, hosted on a
  subdomain provided by a free hosting service, where I published a
  subset of the articles from the intranet portal.  Both the intranet
  portal and the public website had guestbooks.  The guestbook on the
  public website was powered by a CGI script provided by the hosting
  service, which inserted each comment directly into the guestbook
  HTML page.  As some of you might guess, yes, it was vulnerable to
  cross-site scripting, but that's beside the point.
</p>
<p>
  After leaving the university, I registered my own domain name and
  set up my current website on the World Wide Web and included some of
  the content from both the original intranet portal and the old
  public website.  For some reason, though, I never thought to include
  a guestbook.  And so this website went on without a guestbook for
  the next 20 years.  Finally, in June 2025, I decided to bring the
  guestbook back.  I already had a commenting system implemented for
  this website using Common Lisp and Hunchentoot, so I simply reused
  it for the guestbook.  The
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/0.3.0/form.lisp">server program</a>
  accepts POST requests to receive comments and writes them to text
  files on the web server for manual review.  The comments are then
  rendered as static HTML pages by my static site generator.  In a
  way, it is less a comment system and more a static comment pages
  generator.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I could not restore all the comments from the
  original guestbooks.  The ASP source code of my intranet portal as
  well as the guestbook database are now lost to time.  Note that what
  I refer to as ASP here is now known as Classic ASP, to avoid
  confusion with ASP.NET.  A CD-ROM backup eventually succumbed to
  disc rot and with it vanished the source code and the database.  But
  a handful of comments had survived because they had found their way
  into other files and correspondence and I have now included them
  here.  I had better luck with the guestbook of the old public
  website, from which I was able to recover a greater number of
  comments.  It is still only a small fraction of what once existed,
  but it feels good to have even those fragments preserved.  The new
  guestbook is now available here:
  <a href="guestbook.html">Guestbook</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I wasn't expecting anybody to notice the new guestbook.  It is only
  mentioned in the <a href="about.html">About</a> and
  <a href="links.html">Links</a> pages, neither of which see much
  traffic.  Here are a few examples:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I love that your website has a guestbook!  :D
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Love the guestbook!  We need more of these.  Makes you feel
    invited.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It's a small addition to my website, but after two decades, it feels
  good to see the guestbook alive again and even better to see
  visitors enjoying it!

<title>QuickQWERTY 1.1.0</title>
<link>https://susam.net/code/news/quickqwerty/1.1.0.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  There has been a new release of QuickQWERTY after over 10 years!
  QuickQWERTY is a web-based touch typing tutor for QWERTY keyboards
  that runs directly in the web browser.  You can try it out
  here: <a href="../../../quickqwerty.html">quickqwerty.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The new release, version 1.1.0 of QuickQWERTY, introduces a new
  input command named <code>reset</code>, which is a synoymn for the
  existing commands <code>restart</code> and <code>rst</code> used to
  restart the current lesson.  Another input command
  named <code>test</code> runs an internal suite of tests to validate
  that no lesson involves keys that have not been introduced in the
  current or prior lessons.  Further, in this release, the application
  has been fully rewritten as a single standalone HTML file with no
  external dependencies and the source code has been greatly
  simplified.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of other changes too.  Words per minute (WPM)
  calculation has been refined so the first character, which starts
  the timer, is not counted.  The guides have been enhanced.  Keys to
  be pressed are now highlighted more clearly and reminders to return
  fingers to their home positions have been added to each guide.  The
  confirmation dialogue for switching between 6-7 split and 5-6 split
  styles now uses the HTML <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element,
  replacing the dated <code>window.confirm()</code> prompt.  In
  addition, when the application is opened without a fragment
  identifier in the URL, the most recently practised lesson loads
  automatically.
</p>
<p>
  The user interface has been simplified.  The previous and next links
  (<code>&laquo;</code> and <code>&raquo;</code>) for navigating
  lessons have been removed, as they added little value and made the
  layout of the various user interface components more complex.  The
  "Next lesson" advice link remains for moving to the next lesson when
  the current one is completed successfully.  Tooltips showing
  additional typing metrics have also been removed due to limited
  usefulness.
</p>
<p>
  The lessons have been updated to remove spellings specific to
  American English.  Care has been taken to use only words that are
  spelled the same in American and British English with one exception.
  The word "tyre", in its British English spelling, was mistakenly
  left in the lesson.  That will be fixed in the next release.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, QuickQWERTY's license has changed from the BSD-2-Clause
  licence to the MIT licence.  The source code is available at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/quickqwerty">github.com/susam/quickqwerty</a>.
  To run this release and learn touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard, go
  to <a href="../../../quickqwerty.html">quickqwerty.html</a>.

<title>My Blogroll Is Now My Feed Reader</title>
<link>https://susam.net/blogroll-as-feed-reader.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">mbmfr</guid>
<pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  On a particularly hot summer weekend last month, I implemented a new
  feature for this website: a blogroll that lists recent entries from
  my favourite blogs.  Check it out here: <a href="roll.html">roll.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It has been nearly two weeks since I set up this blogroll and it has
  already changed how I keep up with my feeds.  I no longer bother
  with feed readers or aggregators.  I could never quite make a habit
  of using them regularly anyway.  Thanks to this simple addition to
  my website, I find myself visiting my blogroll often.  It has earned
  a permanent place in my bookmarks.  When I have some spare time, I
  click on the bookmark, visit my blogroll and, when I find new posts
  appear there, I click through and read the full blog posts.
</p>
<p>
  Credit for this nifty and surprisingly effective idea goes to Alex
  Kladov.  It was Alex's website,
  <a href="https://matklad.github.io/">matklad.github.io</a>, that
  inspired me to implement my own blogroll.  It showed me that a
  blogroll can be more than just a static list of links.  It can be a
  regularly updated page that highlights new posts from the blogs I
  follow.
</p>
<p>
  I suspect the fact that my blogroll is generated by my own
  handcrafted <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/main/roll.lisp">Common
  Lisp program</a> plays a part in why I enjoy using it.  There is a
  certain joy in using something you have built yourself.  At last, I
  feel I can stay on top of my feeds!  If you maintain a personal
  website and struggle to keep up with your feeds, I recommend this
  approach.  Writing the blogroll generator was a fun weekend project
  and it has greatly improved how I spend my spare time online!

<title>Noise From My Feeds</title>
<link>https://susam.net/feed-noise.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">xjdrj</guid>
<pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
  Hello!  If you are subscribed to this website's feeds, you may have
  noticed something odd recently.  Your feed reader might have shown a
  bunch of old posts as if they were published today.  If that
  happened with your feed reader, I apologise for the noise.  I hope
  this post will give you some clarity on why this happened.  The
  reason for this noise is a change to the way the RSS feeds are
  generated for this website.  Each post in the feeds includes a GUID,
  which is used by many feed readers to decide whether a post is new
  or if it has been seen already.  Until now, the GUID was simply the
  post's URL, like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;url&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;guid&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/guid&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  However, today this has changed to a short unique string, like so:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;url&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;guid isPermaLink="false"&gt;rxpnz&lt;/guid&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If your feed reader looks at this GUID value to decide whether a new
  post has been published, it will show you a whole bunch of old posts
  once again in your reader, as if they were new.  These GUIDs won't
  change again in the future, so this is a one-time problem.  The full
  URL of the post is still present in the feeds, as you can see in the
  example above, so your feed reader still knows where to take you if
  you wish to visit this website to read a post.  The short string
  serves as a unique identifier for each post.
</p>
<p>
  This website is a passion project I work on in my spare time.
  Sometimes, after publishing a post, I realise the title could be
  sharper or the URL could be cleaner.  I make the necessary changes
  and set up HTTP redirects on my web server, so that visitors using
  the old URL are still taken to the updated location of the post.
  Previously, however, the GUID (being the URL) changed too, which
  caused many feed readers to treat the updated post as a new one even
  when it wasn't.  Switching to stable GUIDs prevents this problem
  from occurring again.  The GUIDs now stay the same no matter what
  changes I make behind the scenes, which means no more unnecessary
  noise in your feed reader.
</p>
<p>
  I am sorry if this caused any confusion or clutter.  If your feed
  reader is currently flooded with old posts appearing as new, the
  best solution is to mark those items as read.  Thank you for your
  patience with this issue.  I hope to keep future surprises limited
  to content, not configuration.

<title>More Contrast, Please</title>
<link>https://susam.net/more-contrast-please.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">ygqwk</guid>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  So you have decided to go with a dark theme for your website.  Great
  choice!  I love dark themes too!  My journey with computers began
  with monochrome CRT monitors, where white text was displayed on dark
  background.  I am still very fond of that colour scheme.  Done well,
  dark themes can be elegant and easy on the eyes.  But there is a
  common pitfall that I see all too often in modern web design &ndash;
  the overuse of low-contrast colour schemes.  This is something worth
  keeping in mind while crafting a new theme.
</p>
<p>
  Take a look at this example where the text colour
  is <code>#777777</code> and the background is <code>#222222</code>:
</p>
<p style="background: #222222; color: #777777; padding: 1em; text-align: center; font-size: 1rem; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif">
  The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
</p>
<p>
  I am hoping that most people would agree that the colour contrast
  above is too low.  I certainly find it uncomfortable to read.
  However, the situation becomes a bit less clear with the following
  example, where the text colour is set to <code>#A9A9B3</code> and the background
  is <code>#2A2A2D</code>:
</p>
<p style="background: #2a2a2d; color: #a9a9b3; padding: 1em; text-align: center; font-size: 1rem; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif">
  The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
</p>
<p>
  The above example is, in fact, based on a real website I came across
  today.  Now this is definitely better than the first example and I
  am sure some people would find this perfectly acceptable.  However,
  I still find this uncomfortable to read.  In fact, I have realised
  that as I get older, I need a higher contrast ratio to make the text
  more comfortable to read.
</p>
<p>
  I would suggest that any colour choices for foreground text and
  background page colours should, at the very least, meet
  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-enhanced">Web
  Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AAA</a>
  recommendations.  This means the contrast ratio for normal-sized
  text against the background should be at least 7:1.  There are also
  the slightly weaker Level AA guidelines, which require that
  normal-sized text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.  That
  said, I personally recommend aiming for a 7:1 contrast ratio
  regardless.
</p>
<p>
  The first example above has a contrast ratio of just 3.6:1, meaning
  it fails to meet both the Level AA and Level AAA requirements.  The
  second example, on the other hand, has a contrast ratio of
  6.1:1.  While it satisfies the Level AA requirements, it still falls
  short of meeting the Level AAA standards.
</p>
<p>
  To calculate the contrast ratio according to
  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G17.html#tests">WCAG
  contrast formula</a>, use one of these tools:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="contrast.html">My Colour Contrast Calculator</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If we improve the contrast for the second example above, we would
  need to choose a brighter shade for the text, such as
  <code>#B7B7BE</code>.  On the dark background <code>#2A2A2D</code>,
  this results in a contrast ratio of 7.2:1.  Here is how it looks:
</p>
<p style="background: #2a2a2d; color: #b7b7be; padding: 1em; text-align: center; font-size: 1rem; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif">
  The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
</p>
<p>
  I definitely find this much easier to read.  If you are developing a
  dark colour theme for your web page or software, I request you to
  run your colours through a contrast calculator tool and ensure the
  contrast ratio is greater than 7:1.  Anything less and the theme
  might become uncomfortable for people like me.  Small adjustments
  like this can significantly improve readability and comfort for your
  readers.

<title>More Purple Links, Please</title>
<link>https://susam.net/more-purple-links-please.html</link>

<p>
  While I am browsing the Web, one thing I always like to see is a
  page with purple links.  Since the early days of the Web, purple has
  has become the default colour for visited links.  Here's a relevant
  note from the
  <a href="https://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/archives/WWW-TALK/www-talk-1993q2.messages/47.html">changelog</a>
  of NCSA Mosaic 0.13 (1993):
</p>
<blockquote>
  Changed default anchor representations: blue and single solid
  underline for unvisited, dark purple and single dashed underline for
  visited.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Visiting a web page and finding purple links brings a sense of ease.
  The purple links indicate that I am familiar with some of the
  references the web page makes to other articles.  Each purple link
  serves as a small marker of a prior journey, a reminder that I've
  explored certain paths before.  To me, purple links are like
  well-worn books with faded covers and creased spines.  Blue links,
  on the other hand, are like new books, to be opened and explored.
</p>
<p>
  Although I'm quite fond of purple links, I know that not everyone
  shares this sentiment.  Modern web design trends have moved away
  from this tradition, favouring sleek, minimalist aesthetics where
  visited and unvisisted links look nearly the same.  While this can
  be visually appealing, in my opinion, it detracts from the
  experience of using the Web as a source of knowledge.  When links
  look indistinguishable or unconventional, it can be hard to tell
  what I've already read, especially when I am revisiting a topic and
  want to easily spot the links that are new.
</p>
<p>
  Now it is not hard to change the visited link style with a little
  userscript.  For example the following userscript can override the
  website's stylesheet to colour visited links purple again:
</p>
<pre>
<code>// ==UserScript==
// @name Purple Links
// @match *://*/*
// ==/UserScript==
document.head.appendChild(document.createElement('style'))
document.head.lastElementChild.innerHTML = 'a:visited {color: #518}'</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This little userscript should work well on most web pages with light
  backgrounds.  But if a web page uses a dark theme or a custom colour
  scheme, then the above userscript may need adjustments to either
  handle other colour schemes gracefully.
</p>
<p>
  To me, the purple links serve as small reminders of all the digital
  paths I've already walked.  I wish more websites would honour this
  convention.  More purple links, please.

<title>PDF Dimmer Bookmarklet</title>

<p>
  I often read PDF documents in Firefox and sometimes I prefer to work
  in dark mode, especially at night when the room lights are dimmed.
  However, the bright white background of the Firefox PDF viewer can
  be glaring and uncomfortable when dark mode is enabled.
  Additionally, writing a userscript to invert the background and text
  colours in the PDF viewer does not work.  I have confirmed with
  Firefox version 137.0 that userscripts do not run within the PDF
  viewer.
</p>
<p>
  For example, consider this simple userscript that just prints a
  "hello" message when a web page loads:
  <a href="code/lab/userscript/hello.js">hello.js</a>.  This script
  works on regular web pages but does not execute when viewing a PDF
  file in Firefox.
  See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1454760">Bug
  1454760</a> for more details about this restriction.
</p>
<p>
  While userscripts are often my go-to solution for customisations
  like this, for this particular problem, I resorted to writing a tiny
  bookmarklet to work around the above limitation.  Here is the
  bookmarklet:
</p>
<pre><code>javascript:(()=&gt;{['thumbnailView','viewer'].map(id=&gt;document.getElementById(id).style.filter='invert(0.9)saturate(0)')})()</code></pre>
<p>
  To add this to Firefox, from the Firefox menu, select "Bookmarks".
  Then in the left sidebar, right click on either "Bookmarks Toolbar"
  or "Bookmarks Menu", depending on where you want to add the
  bookmarklet and select "Add Bookmark".  Enter some name in the
  "Name" field and then in the "URL" field, enter the above line of
  code.  Click "Save" and you are done.  The next time you open a PDF
  file in Firefox, find the bookmark in the bookmarks menu or toolbar,
  click on it and it should instantly invert the colour scheme of the
  PDF viewer.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, simply drag the following link and drop it onto your
  Firefox toolbar:
</p>
<p class="textcenter">
  <a href="javascript:(()=%3e%7b%5b'thumbnailView','viewer'%5d.map(id=%3edocument.getElementById(id).style.filter='invert(0.9)saturate(0)')%7d)()">Dim PDF</a>
</p>
<p>
  While the default PDF viewer of Firefox does not support
  userscripts, this bookmarklet is a simple, effective way to give
  PDFs a darker look.  If you're like me and often read books and
  papers in PDF format at night, you might find this handy.

<title>MathB 1.3.0</title>
<link>https://susam.net/code/news/mathb/1.3.0.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  MathB 1.3.0 is likely the final update of MathB, a web-based
  mathematics pastebin service.  The online mathematics pastebin
  service previously hosted at <code>https://mathb.in/</code> has been
  shut down today after 13 years of continuous service.  See the post
  <a href="../../../mathbin-is-shutting-down.html">MathB.in Is
  Shutting Down</a> for more details about this.  This release
  captures the state of this project as it was today at the time of
  shutting down the online service.
</p>
<p>
  This update includes a few new features.  For example, there is now
  a configurable runtime property named <code>:expect</code> that can
  be used to enforce the presence of certain tokens in the posts
  submitted by the users.  This feature was used to enforce the
  presence of LaTeX delimiters in the online service, a measure that
  was instrumental in reducing spam to a great extent in the last few
  years.  There are a few other minor changes too.
  See <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb/blob/main/CHANGES.md">CHANGES.md</a>
  for a detailed changelog.
</p>
<p>
  The source code of MathB remains free and open-source, so anyone
  interested in hosting their own instance can still do so.  To access
  the source code of MathB, please visit
  <a href="http://github.com/susam/mathb">github.com/susam/mathb</a>.

<title>MathB.in Is Shutting Down</title>
<link>https://susam.net/mathbin-is-shutting-down.html</link>
<guid isPermaLink="false">rrbdk</guid>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Thirteen years ago, on a quiet Saturday night, I sat down and began
  developing MathB.in.  After coding all through the night, as the sun
  rose on Sunday, 25 March 2012, the website was ready.  I registered
  a new domain name and shared it with a few friends who loved
  mathematics.  Back then, we spent hours discussing fascinating
  mathematics problems and this website became a simple way for us to
  share snippets with each other.  Word spread quickly&mdash;my
  friends shared it with their friends, who passed it along to others.
  The community grew organically.  Then, one day, I announced the
  project on the MathJax mailing list and its reach expanded even
  further.  Within a year, this mathematics pastebin service had users
  from around the world.  Watching the usage of this little project
  grow was an incredibly rewarding experience.
</p>
<figure class="soft">
  <a href="files/blog/mathbin.png"><img
     src="files/blog/mathbin.png"

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  The world has changed a lot since I first published MathB.in.  The
  internet has evolved and so have I.  Maintaining a mathematics
  pastebin service like this single-handedly has become increasingly
  difficult over the years.  Over the past 13 years, I have received
  notices from regulatory authorities whenever someone submitted
  content that triggered compliance concerns.  Each time, my server
  would be taken offline and I would be given a 7-day deadline to boot
  it into rescue mode, remove the offending content and restore
  service.  Missing the deadline would put my server hosting account
  at risk of cancellation.
</p>
<p>
  To prevent these disruptions, I began reviewing and filtering
  incoming content as much as possible every few days.  The
  appreciation and positive feedback from happy users kept me going.
  However, at this stage of my life, I can no longer afford to spend
  time moderating user content.  On top of that, the growing
  complexity of data protection and digital safety regulations places
  a significant burden on me as the maintainer of this service.
  Complying with these regulations requires considerable legal
  expertise that I cannot afford.
</p>
<p>
  Some might suggest that I could improve the spam-detection
  capabilities of this service and indeed, I have done so over the
  years.  However, all anti-spam measures are inherently
  probabilistic.  No matter how much automation is in place, a manual
  review of every post is still necessary to guarantee that all
  content is legitimate.  It only takes one dodgy submission to
  trigger compliance alerts.  While I respect the need for these
  regulations, I do not want to spend my weekends worrying about what
  users from around the world might be posting on this little pastebin
  service.  Nor do I want to be in a constant state of vigilance just
  to keep my server running.  It takes up more time than I can spare.
</p>
<p>
  Some have suggested forming a team of volunteers to review
  submissions, but that does not solve the core issue: since the
  server hosting account is in my name, I would still be responsible
  for remediating any compliance issues or risk having my account
  cancelled.  Another alternative is to move the service under a
  non-profit organisation, but with increased responsibilities in
  other areas of my life, handling the operational demands of such an
  endeavour is far beyond what I can commit to.  After all, this was
  meant to be a fun project built for me and my friends, not something
  that requires me to deal with regulatory issues.
</p>
<p>
  Another alternative would be to encode the content of a MathB.in
  post and embed it into the URL, which could then be distributed with
  others.  Upon visiting the URL, the application would read the
  encoded content from the URL, decode it and render it.  While this
  eliminates the need to store user content on my server, it
  introduces a new concern: the risk of someone sharing URLs with
  malicious content embedded in them.  I am not comfortable with such
  content being rendered on a page served from a domain that I am the
  registrant of.  The regulatory implications of rendering such
  content are also unclear.  I could still be held accountable for
  content rendered on the website, regardless of whether it's stored
  on the server.  This problem could be mitigated to some extent by
  refusing to render content containing known malicious patterns but
  no such solution can be foolproof.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, after much thought, I have regrettably made the
  decision to shut down MathB.in on Sunday, 16 March 2025.  The
  website will go offline on that day.  If you have any important
  posts that you would like to keep, now is the time to copy and save
  them for yourself.
</p>
<p>
  To all of you who have used this project, I want to express my
  sincere gratitude.  Running a project that could serve you in a
  meaningful way has given me a strong sense of accomplishment and
  pride.  To those who are disappointed by this service's closure, I
  am sorry.  I wish I could continue to dedicate the time and effort
  needed to maintain and develop it, but I must acknowledge my
  limitations and step away from a project that has become an artefact
  of my past, not my present.
</p>
<p>
  The source code for this website is available at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">github.com/susam/mathb</a>
  under the MIT license.  Feel free to use the code and set up your
  own instance if you'd like!  Alternatively, consider hosting your
  mathematical snippets and notes on your own web space using a kit
  like MathCask available at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathcask">github.com/susam/mathcask</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I hope you'll hold no hard feelings.  If you have enjoyed
  using MathB.in, I would love to stay connected on the Fediverse.  My
  Mastodon handle is

  See you there!

<title>The IndieWeb Doesn't Need to "Take Off"</title>
<link>https://susam.net/indieweb-does-not-need-to-take-off.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  There's a corner of the Internet where people have been reclaiming
  their digital independence by hosting their own websites and
  promoting the idea of owning your own content.  It's called the
  IndieWeb.  This community has its own
  <a href="https://indieweb.org/">website</a>, IRC channels, social
  media presence, etc., all dedicated to the idea that individuals
  should control their own digital presence through personal websites.
</p>
<p>
  Publishing your own website isn't a new concept.  It is the very
  essence of the Web!  This is what the Web has always been about
  since its early days.  But in an era where corporate-controlled
  platforms dominate online interaction, the IndieWeb emphasises the
  original spirit of the Web, where individuals have control over
  their content, identities and online spaces.  Every time this topic
  arises in online discussions, someone inevitably claims that the
  IndieWeb hasn't taken off!
</p>
<p>
  I feel that such claims about the IndieWeb not "taking off" are
  either stating the obvious or, if that's not the intention,
  completely missing the point.  It's like saying that gardening
  hasn't taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the
  supermarket.  The IndieWeb doesn't need to "take off" to be valuable
  to those who participate in it.  Maintaining a personal website is
  about owning your digital presence, embracing creative freedom and
  expressing your individuality!  It's not about appealing to the
  masses!
</p>
<p>
  I remember how, in the early 2000s, I used to spend my spare time
  learning HTML and writing my website, one HTML tag at a time.
  Writing a few lines of code in a text editor and then watching the
  browser render that code into a vibrant web page full of colours and
  images felt like an art form.  It was doubly fun to find other
  netizens who shared that same joy of maintaining and publishing
  their websites.  The IndieWeb is about preserving that hacker
  culture where websites are crafted and hosted not for mass appeal
  but for the sheer joy of creation and sharing with like-minded
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  The IndieWeb doesn't need to go mainstream to be meaningful.  It's a
  celebration of a more personal, decentralised and creative world
  wide web.  For those of us who still care about these values, it is
  already meaningful.

<p>
  FXYT 0.5.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, esoteric, stack-based,
  postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36 simple commands.
  This release fixes an annoying bug that has been affecting some
  mobile device users for a while.  On some mobile web browsers, such
  as Chrome on Samsung Galaxy S8, the drawing canvas would appear to
  be larger than the viewport thus overflowing the visible screen on
  the mobile device.  The user would then be required to manually zoom
  out in order to use this tool conveniently.  This issue has been
  fixed in this release.
</p>
<p>
  If you follow my <a href="../../../cfrs.html">CFRS[]</a> project,
  you might have noticed yesterday that a very similar fix has gone
  into CFRS[] too.  For more details about that, see
  the release page for <a href="../cfrs/0.3.0.html">CFRS[] 0.3.0</a>.

<p>
  FXYT 0.4.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, esoteric, stack-based,
  postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36 simple commands.
  This release increases the maximum allowed code length from 256
  bytes to 1024 bytes.  This means there is now more room for writing
  more complex FXYT programs!
</p>
<p>
  Further, the maximum code length for distributable demo links has
  been increased from 64 bytes to 256 bytes.  This allows several more
  impressive demos to have their own distributable links.  As a
  specific example of one such demo, take a look at
  this <a href="https://susam.net/fxyt.html#XTsN128dN3142pN128qDN3142gbN6284dcDN1571gbN3142SdcDNN1571dlbNN3142dSdcDDN166SDpN120000qdSDpN1000qpN1000qN1000SdpN1000qN1100sN3pN25qYgNSbPN255c">animated
