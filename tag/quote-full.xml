<p>
  I recently came across a beautiful and thoughtful answer on
  MathOverflow by the late mathematician William Thurston.  A brief
  background about him from
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thurston">Wikipedia
  article</a> about him:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    William Paul Thurston (October 30, 1946 &ndash; August 21, 2012)
    was an American mathematician.  He was a pioneer in the field of
    low-dimensional topology and was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982
    for his contributions to the study of 3-manifolds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thurston was a professor of mathematics at Princeton University,
    University of California at Davis and Cornell University.  He was
    also a director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute.
  </p>
</blockquote>

  before 08 Apr 2011 (UTC) are available under the terms of the

  licence.  Thurston wrote the answer I am about to share on 30 Oct
  2010.  Due to the licence terms, this post too is available under
  the terms of the same licence.
</p>
<p>
  Thurston posted his answer while replying to a MathOverflow
  question:
  <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/43690"><em>What's a
  mathematician to do?</em></a>.  The question enquires about how an
  ordinary mathematician can contribute to mathematics.  Thurston's
  answer
  from <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/44213">mathoverflow.net/a/44213</a>
  is reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It's not <em>mathematics</em> that you need to contribute to.
    It's deeper than that: how might you contribute to humanity, and
    even deeper, to the well-being of the world, by pursuing
    mathematics?  Such a question is not possible to answer in a
    purely intellectual way, because the effects of our actions go far
    beyond our understanding.  We are deeply social and deeply
    instinctual animals, so much that our well-being depends on many
    things we do that are hard to explain in an intellectual way.
    That is why you do well to follow your heart and your passion.
    Bare reason is likely to lead you astray.  None of us are smart
    and wise enough to figure it out intellectually.
  </p>
  <p>
    The product of mathematics is clarity and understanding.  Not
    theorems, by themselves.  Is there, for example any real reason
    that even such famous results as Fermat's Last Theorem, or the
    Poincar&eacute; conjecture, really matter?  Their real importance
    is not in their specific statements, but their role in challenging
    our understanding, presenting challenges that led to mathematical
    developments that increased our understanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    The world does not suffer from an oversupply of clarity and
    understanding (to put it mildly).  How and whether specific
    mathematics might lead to improving the world (whatever that
    means) is usually impossible to tease out, but mathematics
    collectively is extremely important.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think of mathematics as having a large component of psychology,
    because of its strong dependence on human minds.  Dehumanized
    mathematics would be more like computer code, which is very
    different.  Mathematical ideas, even simple ideas, are often hard
    to transplant from mind to mind.  There are many ideas in
    mathematics that may be hard to get, but are easy once you get
    them.  Because of this, mathematical understanding does not expand
    in a monotone direction.  Our understanding frequently
    deteriorates as well.  There are several obvious mechanisms of
    decay.  The experts in a subject retire and die, or simply move on
    to other subjects and forget.  Mathematics is commonly explained
    and recorded in symbolic and concrete forms that are easy to
    communicate, rather than in conceptual forms that are easy to
    understand once communicated.  Translation in the direction
    conceptual -&gt; concrete and symbolic is much easier than
    translation in the reverse direction, and symbolic forms often
    replaces the conceptual forms of understanding.  And mathematical
    conventions and taken-for-granted knowledge change, so older texts
    may become hard to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, mathematics only exists in a living community of
    mathematicians that spreads understanding and breaths life into
    ideas both old and new.  The real satisfaction from mathematics is
    in learning from others and sharing with others.  All of us have
    clear understanding of a few things and murky concepts of many
    more.  There is no way to run out of ideas in need of
    clarification.  The question of who is the first person to ever
    set foot on some square meter of land is really secondary.
    Revolutionary change does matter, but revolutions are few, and
    they are not self-sustaining --- they depend very heavily on the
    community of mathematicians.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the comments to the answer, one of the commenters
  was <a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/">Suresh
  Venkatasubramanian</a> who was a professor in the School of
  Computing at the University of Utah back then.  He
  is <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/suresh">now</a> a
  professor of Computer Science and Data Science at Brown University.
  In his <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43690/whats-a-mathematician-to-do/44213#comment271029_44213">comment</a>,
  Suresh proposed that this answer be called <em>Thurston's
  Paean</em>.  Here is his complete comment:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    This seems like an ideal counterpoint to Hardy's Lament.  I'm
    calling it Thurston's Paean :).  Seems poignant now that he has
    passed.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Thurston's answer does appear to be a perfect complement to Hardy's
  lament in the 1940 essay <em>A Mathematician's Apology</em>.  While
  Hardy's lament is remarkably beautiful and introspective, it may
  also feel a little depressing at places.  Thurston's post on the
  other hand is full of hope and purpose that goes beyond the actual
  work of doing mathematics.  Indeed <em>Thurston's Paean</em> is a
  befitting title for his answer.

  Quoting from the article
  <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf">Comme

  Alexandre Grothendieck</a> by Allyn Jackson published in <em>Notices

</p>
<blockquote>
  One striking characteristic of Grothendieck's mode of thinking is
  that it seemed to rely so little on examples.  This can be seen in
  the legend of the so-called "Grothendieck prime".  In a mathematical
  conversation, someone suggested to Grothendieck that they should
  consider a particular prime number.  "You mean an actual number?"
  Grothendieck asked.  The other person replied, yes, an actual prime
  number.  Grothendieck suggested, "All right, take 57."

<h2 id="optimal-lecture-time">Optimal Lecture Time<a href="#optimal-lecture-time"></a></h2>
<p>
  I recently found this interesting paragraph from an article titled
  <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf">Ten
  Lessons I Wish I Had Been Taught</a> that is based on a talk
  presented by Gian-Carlo Rota in Apr 1996:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.
  After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say)
  everybody's attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to
  prove the Riemann hypothesis.  One minute overtime can destroy the
  best of lectures.
</blockquote>
<p>
  That's fine advice.  In fact, the whole article is full of good
  advice like this.  Although it was written primarily for
  mathematicians, a lot of what is said in the article applies quite
  well to professionals in other fields too.
</p>
<p>
  The excerpt I have quoted above got me thinking about exactly how
  long a microcentury is.  It couldn't be exactly 50 minutes, could
  it?
</p>
<h2 id="wiktionary-on-microcentury">Wiktionary on Microcentury<a href="#wiktionary-on-microcentury"></a></h2>
<p>
  The English Wiktionary entry for
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury">microcentury</a>
  (as of
  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=microcentury&amp;oldid=59316064">revision
  59316064</a> on 7 May 2020) mentions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  A time period of a millionth of a century, equal to 52 minutes and
  34 seconds.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Not a standard unit of measurement and used mostly humorously to
  denote the maximum length of a lecture.
</blockquote>
<p>
  This looks incorrect to me.  This is based on the oversimplified
  assumption that a century contains 36500 days, that is, it assumes
  that a century is a span of 100 years where each year has exactly
  365 days.  If a century were to have exactly 36500 days, then indeed
  it would have 3&#8239;153&#8239;600&#8239;000 seconds and one
  millionth of it would be 3153.6 seconds which is equivalent to 52
  minutes 33.6 seconds.  This looks consistent with the Wiktionary
  entry.  However, an actual century on the calendar does not have
  exactly 36500 days.  Some years are leap years, so the actual number
  of days in a century is more than that.
</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions<a href="#assumptions"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us find out how long a microcentury is as accurately as
  possible.  We will count the leap years.  We will ignore leap
  seconds because they are irregularly spaced and unpredictable.  We
  will also ignore the following gap between 2 Sep 1752 and 14 Sep
  1752 when the British Empire switched from the Julian calendar to
  the Gregorian calendar:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>cal 9 1752</kbd>
   September 1752
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The above output can be obtained by running the <code>cal</code>
  command as shown above on a Unix or Linux system.  Ignoring this gap
  is equivalent to assuming that we are working with the Gregorian
  calender since the year 1 AD.
</p>
<p>
  We will call a year that is a multiple of 100 to be a <em>centurial
  year</em>.  Further, we will not debate whether a centurial year
  begins a new century or ends one, that is, we don't care whether the
  current century runs from 2001 to 2100 or if it runs from 2000 to
  2099.  The computation presented in the next section works equally
  well for any span of 100 years.
</p>
<h2 id="computation">Computation<a href="#computation"></a></h2>
<p>
  Any span of 100 years contains exactly one centurial year, that is,
  a year that is a multiple of 100.  A centurial year is a leap
  year <em>if and only if</em> it is also a multiple of 400.  Apart
  from the centurial year, a century contains 24 occurrences of years
  that are multiples of 4 and these are all leap years.  From these
  facts, we can conclude that a span of 100 years contains:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Exactly 25 leap years if the centurial year within the span is a
    multiple of 400.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exactly 24 leap years, otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Therefore a century has either 36524 days or 36525 days.  In other
  words, a century has either 3&#8239;155&#8239;673&#8239;600 seconds
  or 3&#8239;155&#8239;760&#8239;000 seconds.  Here is a quick
  demonstration of this with a simple Python program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime

for year in range(1, 2400, 100):
    delta = datetime.date(year + 100, 1, 1) - datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    print('{:04}-{:04}: {} d = {} s'
          .format(year, year + 99, delta.days, delta.total_seconds()))</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is the output of this program:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>0001-0100: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0101-0200: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0201-0300: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0301-0400: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0401-0500: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0501-0600: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0601-0700: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0701-0800: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0801-0900: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0901-1000: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1001-1100: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1101-1200: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1201-1300: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1301-1400: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1401-1500: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1501-1600: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1601-1700: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1701-1800: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1801-1900: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1901-2000: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
2001-2100: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2101-2200: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2201-2300: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2301-2400: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Thus one millionth of a century has 3155.6736 or 3155.7600 seconds,
  that is 52 minutes 35.6736 seconds or 52 minutes 35.7600 seconds.
</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#Conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  If we round off the number of seconds in a microcentury to one
  decimal place, we can say that a microcentury has 52 minutes 35.7
  seconds.

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Back in 2009, I had completed a year working for RSA Security.  I
  was then looking for more intellectually stimulating work where I
  could work on projects involving mathematics and algorithms.  While
  I had talked to senior leaders of the organisation about my
  aspirations, nothing concrete had materialised for several weeks.
  Then something interesting happened.  One fine Monday morning, as I
  walked into the office and began to settle at my desk, the head of
  our research and development division came to my desk looking for
  me.  He said, "Burt is here.  He wants to talk to you."
</p>
<p>
  There was no Burt in that office as far as I knew, so I became a
  little confused.  I was led into a conference room where I could
  meet him.  Mildly disoriented, I opened the conference room door.
  Then I saw Burt, the person I was about to meet.  As soon as I saw
  him, I immediately recognised who he was.  He was Dr Burt Kaliski,
  the Chief Scientist of RSA Laboratories.  He had flown in that
  morning to meet certain teams in our office.  During his visit, he
  had carved out some time from his schedule to meet me.
</p>
<p>
  I had never met or talked to Dr Kaliski before.  But I was very well
  aware of his work and his accomplishments many years before joining
  RSA.  At a previous job, while implementing digital signatures for a
  banking product, I had spent a lot of time reading the RFCs for
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3447">PKCS #1</a>,
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2898">PKCS #5</a> and
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2315">PKCS #7</a>,
  which were all authored by Dr Kaliski.  It was an honour to
  meet the person whose work had taught me a lot and helped me begin
  my career as a software developer in the area of information
  security.
</p>
<p>
  He began the meeting by explaining that he happened to learn about
  my wish to work on more challenging projects.  He enquired about the
  type of projects I desired to work on.  He listened to my thoughts
  patiently.  He offered some advice and then wished me the best for
  my future.  Little did I know back then that the short 30 minute
  interaction I had with him would end up changing the trajectory of
  my career.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after the meeting, I followed his advice, talked to several
  teams, found out what they were working on and finally decided to
  join a team that worked on a network security product.  It turned
  out to be the best decision of my career!  While working on that
  product, I learnt to design and implement efficient algorithms for
  petabytes of data.  Some parts of the project relied heavily on
  probability theory, so it was a joy to be able to take a subject
  that was a hobby until then and apply it to solve actual real-world
  problems.  Working on that product offered the intellectual
  challenges that my younger self yearned for back then.  I think the
  most interesting experience there was my work on parser generators.
  It involved writing algorithms in C++ to parse a formally specified
  language which in turn was used to generate in-memory FSMs to parse
  and analyse network packets and events.  Parsing one language and
  generating in-memory parsers for another language proved to be
  intellectually demanding as well as satisfying.  I have fond
  memories of my time there working on parser generators alongside
  remarkably skilled engineers from whom I learnt a lot.
</p>
<p>
  All of that happened seven years ago.  A couple of months ago, while
  recounting that 30 minute meeting with Dr Kaliski, I could not
  recall if I had ever thanked him properly for his kindness and
  generosity.  Seven years ago, there was no compelling reason for him
  to meet me.  I was then just a regular software engineer who was
  hired into the company a year ago.  We had never talked before.  But
  he took the time to offer me help, suggestions and advice on how I
  could make a good career.  Unsure if I had expressed my gratitude to
  him for how he helped me sculpt my career, I wrote to him recently
  to thank him and explain how that one meeting had a large and
  positive impact on my life.
</p>
<p>
  Dr Kaliski replied a few days later and he expressed his happiness
  to know that the steps I took in the subsequent years worked out
  well for me.  Before ending his message, he wrote a little
  heart-warming note that I am going to remember forever.  Quoting it
  verbatim here:
</p>
<blockquote>
  &ldquo;One of my goals is to be able to provide encouragement to
  others who are developing their careers, just as others have
  invested in mine, passing good blessings from one generation to
  another.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
<!-- Quote from 11 Oct 2016 03:50  UTC -->
<p>
  Thank you, Burt!  I will do likewise.

<p>
  Here is a famous quote by Alan J. Perlis taken from
  the <em>Dedication</em> section of the book <em>Structure and
  Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>, 2nd ed. (1996) written by
  Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman.
</p>
<blockquote>
  I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer
  science keep fun in computing.  When it started out, it was an awful
  lot of fun.  Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now
  and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints
  seriously.  We began to feel as if we really were responsible for
  the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines.  I don't
  think we are.  I think we're responsible for stretching them,
  setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house.  I
  hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun.

  I was learning Perl last weekend from the book <em>Learning
  Perl</em>, 3rd Edition by Randal L. Schwartz and Tom Phoenix.  While
  reading the book, I came across these lines:
</p>
<blockquote>
  It's easier to type <code>$pi</code> than \( \pi, \) especially if
  you don't have Unicode.  And it will be easy to maintain the program
  in case the value of \( \pi \) ever changes.<sup>379</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The corresponding footnote mentions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>
    <sup>379</sup> It nearly did change by a legislative act in the
    state of Indiana.
    <a href="http://www.urbanlegends.com/legal/pi_indiana.htm">http://www.urbanlegends.com/legal/pi_indiana.htm</a>
  </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I searched the web and found that the original urbanlegends.com
  website is no longer there.  However while searching for it, I came
  across this brilliant piece of humour archived in the article titled
  <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alabamas-slice-of-pi/">Alabama's
  Slice of Pi</a> on Snopes.  It is a fictitious report on a state
  legislature redefining the value of \( \pi \) to 3.

  The Snopes article mentions that this piece of humour was first
  posted in a newsgroup.  Then people started circulating it as hoax
  from there.  Here are some of the intriguing and funny bits from it:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Lawson called into question the usefulness of any number that cannot
  be calculated exactly, and suggested that never knowing the exact
  answer could harm students' self-esteem.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  Scientists have arbitrarily assumed that space is Euclidean, he
  says.  He points out that a circle drawn on a spherical surface has
  a different value for the ratio of circumfence to diameter.
</blockquote>
<p>
  In fact, with a little geometry we can see that if a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland">flatlander</a>
  living on a globe with diameter \( D \) draws a circle of diameter
  \( d \) assuming that he is on a flat surface, then the ratio of the
  circumference \( c \) to the diameter \( d \) is

  \[
    \frac{c}{d} = \frac{\pi D}{d} \sin{\frac{d}{D}}.
  \]

  Here are a few more excerpts from the Snopes article:
</p>
<blockquote>
  "These nabobs waltzed into the capital with an arrogance that was
  breathtaking," Learned said.  "Their prefatorial deficit resulted in
  a polemical stance at absolute contraposition to the legislature's
  puissance."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  One member of the state school board, Lily Ponja, is anxious to get
  the new value of pi into the state's math textbooks, but thinks that
  the old value should be retained as an alternative.  She said, "As
  far as I am concerned, the value of pi is only a theory, and we
  should be open to all interpretations."  She looks forward to
  students having the freedom to decide for themselves what value pi
  should have.

  By the way, the real event that the footnote in the
  <em>Learning Perl</em> book mentioned is
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill">Indiana
  Pi Bill</a>.

  There is a wonderful story about a legendary Lisp debugging story in
  the <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/lather-rinse-repeat-a-tour-of-the-repl.html">second
  chapter</a> of the book <em>Practical Common Lisp</em> by Peter
  Seibel.  Quoting the story here:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    An even more impressive instance of remote debugging occurred on
    NASA's 1998 Deep Space 1 mission.  A half year after the space
    craft launched, a bit of Lisp code was going to control the
    spacecraft for two days while conducting a sequence of
    experiments.  Unfortunately, a subtle race condition in the code
    had escaped detection during ground testing and was already in
    space.  When the bug manifested in the wild--100 million miles
    away from Earth--the team was able to diagnose and fix the running
    code, allowing the experiments to complete.  One of the
    programmers described it as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Debugging a program running on a $100M piece of hardware that is
      100 million miles away is an interesting experience.  Having a
      read-eval-print loop running on the spacecraft proved invaluable
      in finding and fixing the problem.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The original source of this story is an article
  called <a href="https://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">Lisping at
  JPL</a> written by Ron Garret in 2002.  This story occurs in the
  section called <em>1994-1999 - Remote Agent</em> of the article.
