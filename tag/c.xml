<p>
  I learnt C from the book <em>The C Programming Language, 2nd
  ed.</em> (K&amp;R) written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
  about 18 years ago during my engineering studies.  The subject of
  pointers was generally believed to be scary among fellow students
  and many of them bought pretty fat books that were dedicated solely
  to the topic of pointers.  However, when I reached Chapter 5 of the
  book , I found that it did a wonderful job at teaching pointers in
  merely 34 pages.  The chapter opens with this sentence:
</p>
<blockquote>
  A pointer is a variable that contains the address of a variable.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The exact point at which the whole topic of pointers became crystal
  clear was when I encountered this sentence in &sect; 5.3 Pointers
  and Arrays:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Rather more surprising, at first sight, is the fact that a reference
  to <code>a[i]</code> can also be written as <code>*(a+i)</code>.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Indeed, it was easy to confirm that by compiling and running the
  following program:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int a[] = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
    printf("%d\n", *(a + 2));
    printf("%d\n", a[2]);
    printf("%d\n", 2[a]);
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The output is:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>5
5
5</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  C was the first serious programming language I was learning back
  then and at that time, I don't think I could have come across a
  better book than K&amp;R to learn this subject.  Like many others, I
  too feel that this book is a model for technical writing.  I wish
  more technical books were written like this with clear presentation
  and concise treatment.

<title>Leap Year Test in K&amp;R</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  About 18 years ago, while learning to program a computer using C, I
  learnt the following test for leap year from the book <em>The C
  Programming Language, 2nd ed.</em> (K&amp;R) written by Brian
  Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.  Section 2.5 (Arithmetic Operators) of
  the book uses the following test:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0</code>
</pre>
<p>
  It came as a surprise to me.  Prior to reading this, I did not know
  that centurial years are not leap years except for those centurial
  years that are also divisible by 400.  Until then, I always
  incorrectly thought that all years divisible by 4 are leap years.  I
  have witnessed only one centurial year, namely the year 2000, which
  happens to be divisible by 400.  As a result, the year 2000 proved
  to be a leap year and my misconception remained unchallenged for
  another few years until I finally came across the above test in
  K&amp;R.
</p>
<p>
  Now that I understand that centurial years are not leap years unless
  divisible by 400, it is easy to confirm this with the
  Unix <code>cal</code> command.  Enter <code>cal 1800</code>
  or <code>cal 1900</code> and we see calendars of non-leap years.
  But enter <code>cal 2000</code> and we see the calendar of a leap
  year.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, the following leap year test is equally effective:
</p>
<pre>
<code>year % 4 == 0 &amp;&amp; (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0)</code>
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
  <strong>Update:</strong> In the
  <a href="comments/leap-year-test-in-knr.html">comments section</a>,
  Thaumasiotes explains why both tests work.  Let me take the liberty
  of elaborating that comment further with a truth table.  We use the
  notation <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>
  respectively, for the three comparisons in the above expressions.
  Then the two tests above can be expressed as the following boolean
  expressions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>(A &amp;&amp; B) || C</code></li>
  <li><code>A &amp;&amp; (B || C)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now normally these two boolean expressions are not equivalent.  The
  truth table below shows this:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th><code>A</code></th>
    <th><code>B</code></th>
    <th><code>C</code></th>
    <th><code>(A &amp;&amp; B) || C</code></th>
    <th><code>A &amp;&amp; (B || C)</code></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
    <td>T</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  We see that there are two cases where the last two columns differ.
  This confirms that the two boolean expressions are not equivalent.
  The two cases where the boolean expressions yield different results
  occur when <code>A</code> is false and <code>C</code> is true.  But
  these cases are impossible!  If <code>A</code> is false
  and <code>C</code> is true, it means we have <code>year % 4 !=
  0</code> and <code>year % 400 == 0</code> which is impossible.
</p>
<p>
  If <code>year % 400 == 0</code> is true, then <code>year % 4 ==
  0</code> must also hold true.  In other words, if <code>C</code> is
  true, <code>A</code> must also be true.  Therefore, the two cases
  where the last two columns differ cannot occur and may be ignored.
  The last two columns are equal in all other cases and that is why
  the two tests we have are equivalent.

      unspecified behavior where each implementation documents how the
      choice is made.
    </p>
    <p>

<title>Loopy C Puzzle</title>
<link>https://susam.net/loopy-c-puzzle.html</link>

<h2 id="integer-underflow">Integer Underflow<a href="#integer-underflow"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us talk a little bit about integer underflow and undefined
  behaviour in C before we discuss the puzzle I want to share in this
  post.
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--) {
        printf(".");
    }
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This code invokes undefined behaviour.  The value in variable
  <code>i</code> decrements to <code>INT_MIN</code> after
  <code>|INT_MIN|</code> iterations.  In the next iteration, there is a
  negative overflow which is undefined for signed integers in C.  On
  many implementations though, <code>INT_MIN - 1</code> wraps around
  to <code>INT_MAX</code>.  Since <code>INT_MAX</code> is not less than
  <code>6</code>, the loop terminates.  With such implementations, this
  code prints print <code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> dots.  With 32-bit integers,
  that amounts to 2147483649 dots.  Here is one such example output:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>gcc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out | wc -c</kbd>
2147483649</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  It is worth noting that the above behaviour is only one of the many
  possible ones.  The code invokes undefined behaviour and the ISO
  standard imposes no requirements on a specific implementation of the
  compiler regarding what the behaviour of such code should be.  For
  example, an implementation could also exploit the undefined
  behaviour to turn the loop into an infinite loop.  In fact, GCC does
  optimise it to an infinite loop if we compile the code with
  the <code>-O2</code> option.
</p>
<pre>
<samp><kbd># This never terminates!</kbd>
$ <kbd>gcc -O2 -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd></samp>
</pre>
<h2 id="puzzle">Puzzle<a href="#puzzle"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us take a look at the puzzle now.
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>
  Add or modify exactly one operator in the following code such that
  it prints exactly 6 dots.
</p>
<pre>
<code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i--) {
    printf(".");
}</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  An obvious solution is to change <code>i--</code>
  to <code>i++</code>.
</p>
<pre>
<code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) {
    printf(".");
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  There are a few more solutions to this puzzle.  One of the solutions
  is very interesting.  We will discuss the interesting solution in
  detail below.
</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions<a href="#solutions"></a></h2>
<p>
  <em><strong>Update on 02 Oct 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been
  solved in the <a href="comments/loopy-c-puzzle.html">comments</a>
  section.  We will discuss the solutions now.  If you want to think
  about the problem before you see the solutions, this is a good time
  to pause and think about it.  There are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Here is a list of some solutions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i &lt; 6; ++i)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; -i &lt; 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i + 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>for (i = 0; i ^= 6; i--)</code>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The last solution involving the bitwise XOR operation is not
  immediately obvious.  A little analysis is required to understand
  why it works.
</p>
<h2 id="generalisation">Generalisation<a href="#generalisation"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us generalise the puzzle by replacing \( 6 \) in the loop with
  an arbitrary positive integer \( n.  \)  The loop in the last
  solution now becomes:
</p>
<pre>
<code>for (i = 0; i ^= n; i--) {
    printf(".");
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If we denote the value of the variable <code>i</code> set by the
  execution of <code>i ^= n</code> after \( k \) dots are printed as
  \( f(k), \) then

  \[
    f(k) =
      \begin{cases}
        0                       &amp; \text{if } k = 0, \\
        n \oplus (f(k - 1) - 1) &amp; \text{if } k \gt 1
      \end{cases}
  \]

  where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is a positive
  integer and the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on
  two nonnegative integers.
</p>
<p>
  Note that \( f(0) \) represents the value of <code>i</code> set by
  the execution of <code>i ^= n</code> when no dots have been printed
  yet.
</p>
<p>
  If we can show that \( n \) is the least value of \( k \) for which
  \( f(k) = 0, \) it would prove that the loop terminates after
  printing \( n \) dots.
</p>
<p>
  We will see in the next section that for odd values of \( n, \)

  \[
    f(k) =
      \begin{cases}
        n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
        1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Therefore there is no value of \( k \) for which \( f(k) = 0 \) when
  \( n \) is odd.  As a result, the loop never terminates when \( n \)
  is odd.
</p>
<p>
  We will then see that for even values of \( n \) and \( 0 \leq k
  \leq n, \)

  \[
    f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
  \]

  Therefore the loop terminates after printing \( n \) dots when
  \( n \) is even.
</p>
<h2 id="lemmas">Lemmas<a href="#lemmas"></a></h2>
<p>
  We will first prove a few lemmas about some interesting properties
  of the bitwise XOR operation.  We will then use it to prove the
  claims made in the previous section.
</p>
<!-- Lemma 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Lemma 1.</strong>
<em>
  For an odd positive integer \( n, \)

  \[
    n \oplus (n - 1) = 1
  \]

  where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
  nonnegative integers.
</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m
  \dots b_1 b_0 \) where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and
  \( b_m \) represents the most significant nonzero bit of \( n.  \)
  Since \( n \) is an odd number, \( b_0 = 1.  \)

  Thus \( n \) may be written as

  \[
    b_m \dots b_1 1.
  \]

  As a result \( n - 1 \) may be written as

  \[
    b_m \dots b_1 0.
  \]

  The bitwise XOR of both binary representations is \( 1.  \)
</p>
<!-- Lemma 2 -->
<p>
  <strong>Lemma 2.</strong>
  <em>
    For a nonnegative integer \( n, \)

    \[
      n \oplus 1 =
      \begin{cases}
      n + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even}, \\
      n - 1 &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd}.
      \end{cases}
    \]

    where the symbol \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two
    nonnegative integers.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  Let the binary representation of \( n \) be \( b_m
  \dots b_1 b_0 \) where \( m \) is a nonnegative integer and
  \( b_m \) represents the most significant nonzero bit of \( n.  \)
</p>
<p>
  If \( n \) is even, \( b_0 = 0.  \)  In this case, \( n \) may be
  written as \( b_m \dots b_1 0.  \)  Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be
  written as \( b_m \dots b_1 1.  \)  Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n + 1.  \)
</p>
<p>
  If \( n \) is odd, \( b_0 = 1.  \)  In this case, \( n \) may be
  written as \( b_m \dots b_1 1.  \)  Thus \( n \oplus 1 \) may be
  written as \( b_m \dots b_1 0.  \)  Therefore \( n \oplus 1 = n - 1.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Note that for odd \( n, \) lemma 1 can also be derived as a
  corollary of lemma 2 in this manner:

  \[
    k \oplus (k - 1)
    = k \oplus (k \oplus 1)
    = (k \oplus k) \oplus 1
    = 0 \oplus 1
    = 1.
  \]
</p>
<!-- Lemma 3 -->
<p>
  <strong>Lemma 3.</strong>
  <em>
    If \( x \) is an even nonnegative integer and \( y \) is an odd
    positive integer, then \( x \oplus y \) is odd, where the symbol
    \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
    integers.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  Let the binary representation of \( x \) be \(
  b_{xm_x} \dots b_{x1} b_{x0} \) and that of \( y \) be \( b_{ym_y}
  \dots b_{y1} b_{y0} \) where \( m_x \) and \( m_y \) are nonnegative
  integers and \( b_{xm_x} \) and \( b_{xm_y} \) represent the most
  significant nonzero bits of \( x \) and \( y \) respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Since \( x \) is even, \( b_{x0} = 0.  \)  Since \( y \) is odd, \(
  b_{y0} = 1.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Let \( z = x \oplus y \) with a binary representation of \( b_{zm_z}
  \dots b_{z1} b_{z0} \) where \( m_{zm_z} \) is a nonnegative integer
  and \( b_{zm_z} \) is the most significant nonzero bit of \( z.  \)
</p>
<p>
  We get \( b_{z0} = b_{x0} \oplus b_{y0} = 0 \oplus 1 = 1.  \)
  Therefore \( z \) is odd.
</p>
<h2 id="theorems">Theorems<a href="#theorems"></a></h2>
<!-- Theorem 1 -->
<p>
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
<em>
  Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
  integers and

  \[
    f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
    n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
    n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n \gt 1.
    \end{cases}
  \]

  where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer and \( n \) is an odd
  positive integer.  Then

  \[
    f(k) =
    \begin{cases}
    n &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is even}, \\
    1 &amp; \text{if } k \text{ is odd}.
    \end{cases}
  \]
</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  This is a proof by mathematical induction.  We have
  \( f(0) = n \) by definition.  Therefore the base case holds good.
</p>
<p>
  Let us assume that \( f(k) = n \) for any even \( k \) (induction
  hypothesis).  Let \( k' = k + 1 \) and \( k'' = k + 2.  \)
</p>
<p>
  If \( k \) is even, we get

  \begin{align*}
    f(k')  &amp; = n \oplus (f(k) - 1)  &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
           &amp; = n \oplus (n - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis)} \\
           &amp; = 1                    &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 1)},\\
    f(k'') &amp; = n \oplus (f(k') - 1) &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
           &amp; = n \oplus (1 - 1)     &amp;&amp; \text{(since \( f(k') = 1 \))} \\
           &amp; = n \oplus 0 \\
           &amp; = n.
  \end{align*}
</p>
<p>
  Since \( f(k'') = n \) and \( k'' \) is the next even number after
  \( k, \) the induction step is complete.  The induction step shows
  that for every even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n \) holds good.  It also
  shows that as a result of \( f(k) = n \) for every even \( k, \) we
  get \( f(k') = 1 \) for every odd \( k'.  \)
</p>
<!-- Theorem 2 -->
<p>
  <strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( \oplus \) denote bitwise XOR operation on two nonnegative
    integers and

    \[
      f(k) =
        \begin{cases}
          n                        &amp; \text{if } n = 0, \\
          n \oplus (f(n - 1) - 1)  &amp; \text{if } n \gt 1.
        \end{cases}
    \]

    where \( k \) is a nonnegative integer, \( n \) is an even
    positive integer and \( 0 \leq k \leq n.  \)  Then

   \[
     f(k) = 0 \iff k = n.
   \]
</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>  We will first show by the principle of mathematical
  induction that for even \( k, \) \( f(k) = n - k.  \)  We have \(
  f(0) = n \) by definition, so the base case holds good.  Now let us
  assume that \( f(k) = n - k \) holds good for any even \( k \) where
  \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) (induction hypothesis).
</p>
<p>
  Since \( n \) is even (by definition) and \( k \) is even (by
  induction hypothesis), \( f(k) = n - k \) is even.  As a result, \(
  f(k) - 1 \) is odd.  By lemma 3, we conclude that \( f(k + 1) = n
  \oplus (f(k) - 1) \) is odd.
</p>
<p>
  Now we perform the induction step as follows:

  \begin{align*}
    f(k + 2) &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) - 1)
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
             &amp; = n \oplus (f(k + 1) \oplus 1)
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
             &amp; = n \oplus ((n \oplus (f(k) - 1)) \oplus 1)
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by definition)} \\
             &amp; = (n \oplus n ) \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1)
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by associativity of XOR)} \\
             &amp; = 0 \oplus ((f(k) - 1) \oplus 1) \\
             &amp; = (f(k) - 1) \oplus 1 \\
             &amp; = (f(k) - 1) - 1
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(from lemma 2 for odd \( n \))} \\
             &amp; = f(k) - 2 \\
             &amp; = n - k - 2
                     &amp;&amp; \text{(by induction hypothesis).}
  \end{align*}

  This completes the induction step and proves that \( f(k) = n - k \)
  for even \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k \leq n.  \)
</p>
<p>
  We have shown above that \( f(k) \) is even for every even \( k \)
  where \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) which results in \( f(k + 1) \) as odd
  for every odd \( k + 1.  \)  This means that \( f(k) \) cannot be \(
  0 \) for any odd \( k.  \)  Therefore \( f(k) = 0 \) is possible only
  even \( k.  \)  Solving \( f(k) = n - k = 0, \) we conclude that \(
  f(k) = 0 \) if and only if \( k = n.  \)

  Here is a silly little C puzzle:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    https://susam.net/
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This code compiles and runs successfully.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>c99 hello.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
hello, world</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  However, the
  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
  standard draft</a> does not mention anywhere that a URL is a valid
  syntactic element in C.  How does this code work then?
</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>Update on 04 Jun 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been
  solved in the <a href="comments/url-in-c.html">comments</a> section.
  If you want to think about the problem before you see the solutions,
  this is a good time to pause and think about it.  There are spoilers
  ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The code works fine because <code>https:</code> is a label and
  <code>//</code> following it begins a comment.  In case, you are
  wondering if <code>//</code> is indeed a valid comment in C, yes, it
  is, since C99.  Download the
  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
  standard draft</a>, go to section 6.4.9 (Comments) and read the
  second point which mentions this:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Except within a character constant, a string literal, or a comment,
  the characters <code>//</code> introduce a comment that includes all
  multibyte characters up to, but not including, the next new-line
  character.  The contents of such a comment are examined only to
  identify multibyte characters and to find the terminating new-line
  character.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="pointer-declarator">Pointer Declarator<a href="#pointer-declarator"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here is a fun puzzle that involves complex type declarations in C:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    Without using <code>typedef</code>, declare <code>x</code> as a
    pointer to a function that takes one argument which is an array of
    10 pointers to functions which in turn take <code>int *</code> as
    their only argument and returns a pointer to a function which
    has <code>int *</code> argument and <code>void</code> return type.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Here is a simpler way to state this puzzle:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <p>
    Without using <code>typedef</code>, declare <code>x</code> as a
    pointer that is equivalent to the following declaration
    of <code>x</code>:
  </p>
<pre>
<code>typedef void (*func_t)(int *);
func_t (*x)(func_t [10]);</code>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
  <em>If you want to think about this puzzle, this is a good time to
  pause and think about it.  There are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Let me describe how I solve such problems.  Let us start from the
  right end of the problem and work our way to the left end defining
  each part one by one.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
  <p>
    <code>void x(int *)</code><br>
    A function that has <code>int *</code> argument and
    <code>void</code> return type.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>void (*x)(int *)</code><br>
    A pointer to a function that has <code>int *</code> argument
    and <code>void</code> return type.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>void (*x())(int *)</code><br>
    A function that returns a pointer to a function that has <code>int
    *</code> argument and <code>void</code> return type.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>void (*x(void (*)(int *)))(int *)</code><br>
    A function that has a pointer to a function that has <code>int
    *</code> argument and <code>void</code> return type as argument
    and returns a pointer to a function which has <code>int *</code>
    argument and <code>void</code> return type.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>void (*x(void (*[10])(int *)))(int *)</code><br>
    A function that has an array of 10 pointers to functions that has
    <code>int *</code> argument and <code>void</code> return type as
    argument and returns a pointer to a function which has <code>int
    *</code> argument and <code>void</code> return type.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>void (*(*x)(void (*[10])(int *)))(int *)</code><br>
    A pointer to a function that has an array of 10 pointers to
    functions that has <code>int *</code> argument and
    <code>void</code> return type as argument and returns a pointer to
    a function which has <code>int *</code> argument and
    <code>void</code> return type.
  </p>
</div>
<h2 id="example-code">Example Code<a href="#example-code"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here is an example that uses the above pointer declaration in a
  program in order to verify that it works as expected:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* A function which has int * argument and void return type.  */
void g(int *a)
{
    printf("g(): a = %d\n", *a);
}

/* A function which has an array of 10 pointers to g()-like functions
   and returns a pointer to a g()-like funciton.  */
void (*f(void (*a[10])(int *)))(int *)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        a[i](&amp;i);
    return g;
}

int main()
{
    /* An array of 10 pointers to g().  */
    void (*a[10])(int *) = {g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g, g};

    /* A pointer to function f().  */
    void (*(*x)(void (*[10])(int *)))(int *) = f;

    /* A pointer to function g() returned by f().  */
    void (*y)(int *a) = x(a);

    int i = 10;
    y(&amp;i);
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is the output of this program:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99 foo.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out
g(): a = 0
g(): a = 1
g(): a = 2
g(): a = 3

<h2 id="skipping-over-a-function-call">Skipping Over a Function Call<a href="#skipping-over-a-function-call"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here is a C puzzle that involves some analysis of the machine code
  generated from it followed by manipulation of the runtime stack.
  The solution to this puzzle is <em>implementation-dependent</em>.
  Here is the puzzle:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<p>
  Consider this C code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Define the function <code>f()</code> such that the output of the
  above code is:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>1
3</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Printing <code>3</code> in <code>f()</code> and exiting is not
  allowed as a solution.
</p>
</div>
<p>
  <em>If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to
  pause and think about it.  There are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>
<p>
  The solution essentially involves figuring out what code we can
  place in the body of <code>f()</code> such that it causes the
  program to skip over the machine code generated for
  the <code>printf("2\n")</code> operation.  I'll share two solutions
  for two different implementations:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    gcc 4.3.2 on 64-bit Debian 5.0.3 running on 64-bit Intel Core 2
    Duo.
  </li>
  <li>
    Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 on 32-bit Windows XP running on
    64-bit Intel Core 2 Duo.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="solution-for-gcc">Solution for GCC<a href="#solution-for-gcc"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us first see step by step how I approached this problem for GCC.
  We add a statement <code>char a = 7;</code> to the function
  <code>f()</code>.  The code looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
    char a = 7;
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  There is nothing special about the number <code>7</code> here.  We
  just want to define a variable in <code>f()</code> and assign some
  value to it.
</p>
<p>
  Then we compile the code and analyse the machine code generated for
  <code>f()</code> and <code>main()</code> functions.
</p>

</pre>
<p>
  When <code>main()</code> calls <code>f()</code>, the microprocessor
  saves the return address (where the control must return to after
  <code>f()</code> is executed) in stack.  The line at offset
  <samp>1d</samp> in the listing above for <code>main()</code> is the
  call to <code>f()</code>.  After <code>f()</code> is executed, the
  instruction at offset <samp>22</samp> is executed.  Therefore the
  return address that is saved on stack is the address at which the
  instruction at offset
  <samp>22</samp> would be present at runtime.
</p>
<p>
  The instructions at offsets <samp>22</samp> and <samp>27</samp> are
  the instructions for the <code>printf("2\n")</code> call.  These are
  the instructions we want to skip over.  In other words, we want to
  modify the return address in the stack from the address of the
  instruction at offset <samp>22</samp> to that of the instruction at
  offset <samp>2c</samp>.  This is equivalent to skipping 10 bytes
  (0x2c - 0x22 = 10) of machine code or adding 10 to the return
  address saved in the stack.
</p>
<p>
  Now how do we get hold of the return address saved in the stack when
  <code>f()</code> is being executed?  This is where the variable
  <code>a</code> we defined in <code>f()</code> helps.  The instruction
  at offset <samp>4</samp> is the instruction generated for
  assigning <code>7</code> to the variable <code>a</code>.
</p>
<p>
  From the knowledge of how microprocessor works and from the machine
  code generated for <code>f()</code>, we find that the following
  sequence of steps are performed during the call to <code>f()</code>:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The microprocessor saves the return address by pushing the content
    of RIP (instruction pointer) register into the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    The function <code>f()</code> pushes the content of the RBP (base
    pointer) register into the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    The function <code>f()</code> copies the content of the RSP (stack
    pointer) register to the RBP register.
  </li>
  <li>
    The function <code>f()</code> stores the byte value <code>7</code>
    at the memory address specified by the content of RBP minus 1.
    This achieves the assignment of the value <code>7</code> to the
    variable <code>a</code>.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  After <code>7</code> is assigned to the variable <code>a</code>, the
  stack is in the following state:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th>Address</th>
    <th>Content</th>
    <th>Size (in bytes)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a + 5</code></td>
    <td>Return address (old RIP)</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a + 1</code></td>
    <td>Old base pointer (old RBP)</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a</code></td>
    <td>Variable <code>a</code></td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  If we add 9 to the address of the variable <code>a</code>, i.e.
  <code>&amp;a</code>, we get the address where the return address is
  stored.  We saw earlier that if we increment this return address by
  10 bytes, it solves the problem.  Therefore here is the solution
  code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
    char a;
    (&amp;a)[9] += 10;
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Finally, we compile and run this code and confirm that the solution
  works fine:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>gcc overwrite.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
1
3</samp>
</pre>
<h2 id="solution-for-visual-studio">Solution for Visual Studio<a href="#solution-for-visual-studio"></a></h2>
<p>
  Now we will see another example solution, this time for Visual
  Studio 2005.
</p>
<p>
  Like before we define a variable <code>a</code> in <code>f()</code>.
  The code now looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
    char a = 7;
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Then we compile the code and analyse the machine code generated from
  it.

<p>
  Just like in the previous <code>objdump</code> listing, in this
  listing too, the instruction at offset <code>4</code> shows where
  the variable <code>a</code> is allocated and the instructions at
  offsets <code>25</code>, <code>2A</code> and <code>2F</code> show
  the instructions we want to skip, i.e. instead of returning to the
  instruction at offset <code>25</code>, we want the microprocessor to
  return to the instruction at offset <code>32</code>.  This involves
  skipping 13 bytes (0x32 - 0x25 = 13) of machine code.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the previous <code>objdump</code> listing, in this listing we
  see that the Visual Studio I am using is a 32-bit on, so it
  generates machine code to use 32-bit registers like EBP, ESP, etc.
  Thus the stack looks like this after <code>7</code> is assigned to
  the variable
  <code>a</code>:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th>Address</th>
    <th>Content</th>
    <th>Size (in bytes)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a + 5</code></td>
    <td>Return address (old EIP)</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a + 1</code></td>
    <td>Old base pointer (old EBP)</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>&amp;a</code></td>
    <td>Variable <code>a</code></td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  If we add 5 to the address of the variable <code>a</code>, i.e.
  <code>&amp;a</code>, we get the address where the return address is
  stored.  Here is the solution code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void f()
{
    char a;
    (&amp;a)[5] += 13;
}

int main()
{
    printf("1\n");
    f();
    printf("2\n");
    printf("3\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Finally, we compile and run this code and confirm that the solution
  works fine:
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  The machine code that the compiler generates for a given C code is
  highly dependent on the implementation of the compiler.  In the two
  examples above, we have two different solutions for two different
  compilers.
</p>
<p>
  Even with the same brand of compiler, the way it generates machine
  code for a given code may change from one version of the compiler to
  another.  Therefore, it is very likely that the above solution would
  not work on another system (such as your system) even if you use the
  same compiler that I am using in the examples above.
</p>
<p>
  However, we can arrive at the solution for an implementation of the
  compiler by determining what number to add to <code>&amp;a</code> to
  get the address where the return address is saved on stack and what
  number to add to this return address to make it point to the
  instruction we want to skip to after <code>f()</code> returns.

<![CDATA[
<p>
  In this post, I will share how I set up big-endian emulation on my
  little-endian Intel machine to tets a program for byte order related
  issues.  I used the QEMU PowerPC emulator to set up the big-endian
  emulation.  The steps to do so are documented in the list below.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Install QEMU.
    </p>
    <pre><code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install qemu</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Download <code>mol-0.9.72.1.tar.bz2</code> from
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-on-linux/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-on-linux/files/</a>
      and copy the file named <code>video.x</code> from the downloaded
      tarball to
      <code>/usr/share/qemu/</code>.  This is necessary to
      prevent <code>qemu-system-ppc</code> from complaining about it.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-on-linux/files/mac-on-linux/mol-0.9.72.1/mol-0.9.72.1.tar.bz2
tar -xjf mol-0.9.72.1.tar.bz2
sudo cp mol-0.9.72.1/mollib/drivers/video.x /usr/share/qemu/</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create a QEMU hard disk image.
    </p>
    <pre><code>qemu-img create powerpc.img 2G</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Download Debian for PowerPC and install it on the QEMU hard disk
      image.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>wget http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/5.0.4/powerpc/iso-cd/debian-504-powerpc-CD-1.iso
qemu-system-ppc -m 512 -boot d -hda powerpc.img -cdrom debian-504-powerpc-CD-1.iso</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Boot the QEMU PowerPC emulator with the new hard disk image.
    </p>
    <pre><code>qemu-system-ppc -m 512 -hda powerpc.img</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Write a small program inside the new Debian system,
      say, <code>endian.c</code> like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int n = 1;
    printf(*((char *) &amp;n) ? "little-endian\n" : "big-endian\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Compile and execute the C program.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>$ <kbd>gcc endian.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
big-endian</code>
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<title>Sequence Points</title>

<![CDATA[
<h2 id="code-examples">Code Examples<a href="#code-examples"></a></h2>
<p>
  A particular type of question comes up often in C programming
  forums.  Here is an example of such a question:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int i = 5;
    printf("%d %d %d\n", i, i--, ++i);
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The output is <code>5 6 5</code> when compiled with GCC and
  <code>6 6 6</code> when compiled with the C compiler that comes with
  Microsoft Visual Studio.  The versions of the compilers with which I
  got these results are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    gcc (Debian 4.3.2-1.1) 4.3.2
  </li>
  <li>
    Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 32-Bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler
    Version 14.00.50727.42 for 80x86
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Here is another example of such a question:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int a = 5;
    a += a++ + a++;
    printf("%d\n", a);
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  In this case, I got the output <code>17</code> with both the
  compilers.
</p>
<p>
  The behaviour of such C programs is undefined.  Consider the
  following two statements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>printf("%d %d %d\n", i, i--, ++i);</code></li>
  <li><code>a += a++ + a++;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  We will see below that in both the statements, the variable is
  modified twice between two consecutive sequence points.  If the
  value of a variable is modified more than once between two
  consecutive sequence points, the behaviour is undefined.  Such code
  may behave differently when compiled with different compilers.
</p>
<h2 id="knr">K&amp;R<a href="#knr"></a></h2>
<p>
  Before looking at the relevant sections of the C99 standard, let us
  see what the book
  <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)">The
  C Programming Language</a></em>, Second Edition says about such C
  statements.  In Section 2.12 (Precedence and Order of Evaluation) of
  the book, the authors write:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    C, like most languages, does not specify the order in which the
    operands of an operator are evaluated.  (The exceptions are
    <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>?:</code>, and
    '<code>,</code>'.)  For example, in a statement like
  </p>
  <pre><code>x = f() + g();</code></pre>
  <p>
    <code>f</code> may be evaluated before <code>g</code> or vice
    versa; thus if either <code>f</code> or <code>g</code> alters a
    variable on which the other depends, <code>x</code> can depend on
    the order of evaluation.  Intermediate results can be stored in
    temporary variables to ensure a particular sequence.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  In the next paragraph, they write,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Similarly, the order in which function arguments are evaluated is
    not specified, so the statement
  </p>
  <pre><code>printf("%d %d\n", ++n, power(2, n));    /* WRONG */</code></pre>
  <p>
    can produce different results with different compilers, depending
    on whether <code>n</code> is incremented before <code>power</code>
    is called.  The solution, of course, is to write
  </p>
<pre>
<code>++n;
printf("%d %d\n", n, power(2, n));</code>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
  They provide one more example in this section:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    One unhappy situation is typified by the statement
  </p>
<pre>
<code>a[i] = i++;</code>
</pre>
  <p>
    The question is whether the subscript is the old value
    of <code>i</code> or the new.  Compilers can interpret this in
    different ways and generate different answers depending on their
    interpretation.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c99">C99<a href="#c99"></a></h2>
<p>
  To read more about this, download the
  <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
  standard</a>, go to section 5.1.2.3 (Program execution) and see the
  second point which mentions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file,
  or calling a function that does any of those operations are
  all <em>side effects</em>,<sup>11)</sup> which are changes in the
  state of the execution environment.  Evaluation of an expression may
  produce side effects.  At certain specified points in the execution
  sequence called <em>sequence points</em>, all side effects of
  previous evaluations shall be complete and no side effects of
  subsequent evaluations shall have taken place.  (A summary of the
  sequence points is given in annex C.)
</blockquote>
<p>
  Then go to section 6.5 and see the second point which mentions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have
  its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an
  expression.<sup>72)</sup> Furthermore, the prior value shall be read
  only to determine the value to be stored.<sup>73)</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Finally go to Annex C (Sequence Points).  It lists all the sequence
  points.  For example, the following is mentioned as a sequence point:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The call to a function, after the arguments have been evaluated
  (6.5.2.2).
</blockquote>
<p>
  This means that in the statement
</p>
<pre><code>printf("%d %d %d\n", i, i--, ++i);</code></pre>
<p>
  there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the three
  arguments (<code>i</code>, <code>i--</code> and <code>++i</code>)
  and before the <code>printf()</code> function is called.  But none
  of the items specified in Annex C implies that there is a sequence
  point between the evaluation of the arguments.  Yet the value
  of <code>i</code> is modified more than once during the evaluation
  of these arguments.  This makes the behaviour of this statement
  undefined.  Further, the value of <code>i</code> is being read not
  only for determining what it must be updated to but also for using
  as arguments to the <code>printf()</code> call.  This also makes the
  behaviour of this code undefined.
</p>
<p>
  Let us see another example of a sequence point from Annex C.
</p>
<blockquote>
  The end of a full expression: an initializer (6.7.8); the expression
  in an expression statement (6.8.3); the controlling expression of a
  selection statement (<code>if</code> or <code>switch</code>)
  (6.8.4); the controlling expression of a <code>while</code>
  or <code>do</code> statement (6.8.5); each of the expressions of
  a <code>for</code> statement (6.8.5.3); the expression in
  a <code>return</code> statement (6.8.6.4).
</blockquote>
<p>
  Therefore in the statement
</p>
<pre><code>a += a++ + a++;</code></pre>
<p>
  there is a sequence point at the end of the complete expression
  (marked with a semicolon) but there is no other sequence point
  before it.  Yet the value of <code>a</code> is modified twice before
  the sequence point.  Thus the behaviour of this statement is
  undefined.

<![CDATA[
<p>
  I have been running a mailing list called <em>ncoders</em> on Yahoo
  Groups for the past few months.  I created it to host discussions on
  computers, programming and network protocols among university
  students.  There are currently about 150 students from various
  universities across the world on the list.  A few weeks ago, someone
  posted a C programming puzzle to the group.  The puzzle asked
  whether it was possible to write a C program such that the
  <code>main()</code> function <em>does not seem to appear</em> in the
  code.  Here's a solution I came up with, which involves obfuscating
  the identifier <code>main</code> using preprocessor macros and
  the <code>##</code> token-pasting operator.
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define decode(s,t,u,m,p,e,d) m ## s ## u ## t
#define begin decode(a,n,i,m,a,t,e)

int begin()
{
    printf("Stumped?\n");
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This program compiles and runs successfully.  Here is the output:
</p>
<pre><samp>Stumped?</samp></pre>
<p>
  Let me explain how this code works.  When the C preprocessor runs on
  this code, the following preprocessing steps occur:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>begin</code> is replaced with <code>decode(a,n,i,m,a,t,e)</code>,
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>decode(a,n,i,m,a,t,e)</code> is replaced with <code>m ## a
    ## i ## n</code> and
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>m ## a ## i ## n</code> is replaced with <code>main</code>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Thus <code>begin()</code> is replaced with <code>main()</code>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Update on 31 Jul 2007:</strong> Although the mailing list
  referred to in this post no longer exists, this tiny piece of code
  seems to have survived on the web.  A
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22decode%28s%2Ct%2Cu%2Cm%2Cp%2Ce%2Cd%29%22">quick
  search</a> shows so many occurrences of this code on the web.  It is
  quite surprising to me that a rather silly piece of code written
  during a Sunday afternoon to solve an equally silly puzzle has been
  the subject of much discussion!

<![CDATA[
<p>
  A quine is a computer program that produces an exact copy of its own
  source code as its output.  It must not consume any input, so tricks
  involving reading its own source code and printing it are not
  permitted.
</p>
<h2 id="classic-quine">The Classic Quine<a href="#classic-quine"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here is a classic quine I came across a few days ago in a mailing
  list:
</p>
<pre><code>main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}</code></pre>
<p>
  This program is written in K&amp;R C.  The current version of GCC
  compiles it fine.  It is a valid quine on ASCII machines because
  this program uses the integer code <code>34</code> to print the
  quotation mark (<code>"</code>) character.  This will be explained
  further in the next section.  On another implementation of the C
  compiler which does not use ASCII code for the quotation mark
  character, the program needs to be modified to the use the correct
  code.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some commands that demonstrate the quine:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>printf '%s' 'main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}' &gt; quine.c</kbd>
$ <kbd>cc quine.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out &gt; out.txt &amp;&amp; diff quine.c out.txt</kbd>
$ <kbd>cat quine.c; echo</kbd>
main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}
$ <kbd>./a.out</kbd>
main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The source code of this quine does not end with a newline.
  The <code>-n</code> option of GNU echo ensures that the source code
  file is created without a terminating newline.
</p>
<h2 id="close-look-at-classic-quine">Close Look at the Classic Quine<a href="#close-look-at-classic-quine"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us take a close look at how the quine introduced in the previous
  section works.  Let us add some newlines in the source code of this
  quine for the sake of clarity.
</p>
<pre>
<code>main()
{
    char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";
    printf(s,34,s,34);
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This is almost the same program presented in the previous section.
  Only a few newlines have been added to it to make the program easier
  to read.
</p>
<p>
  We can see that the <code>printf</code> call uses the
  string <code>s</code> as the format string.  The format string
  contains three conversion specifications:
  <code>%c</code>, <code>%s</code> and <code>%c</code>.  The arguments
  for these conversions are: <code>34</code>, the string
  <code>s</code> itself and <code>34</code> once again.  Note
  that <code>34</code> is the ASCII code for the quotation mark
  character (<code>"</code>).  With that in mind, let us now construct
  the output of the <code>printf</code> call in a step-by-step manner.
</p>
<p>
  The initial portion of the output consists of the format string from
  the beginning up to, but not including, the first conversion
  specification copied unchanged to the output stream.  Here it is:
</p>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s=</samp></pre>
<p>
  Then the first conversion specification <code>%c</code> is
  processed, the corresponnding argument <code>34</code> is taken and
  a quotation mark is printed like this:
</p>
<pre><samp>"</samp></pre>
<p>
  Then the second conversion specification <code>%s</code> is
  processed.  The corresponding argument is the string <code>s</code>
  itself, so the entire string is printed like this:
</p>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp></pre>
<p>
  Then the third conversion specification <code>%c</code> is
  processed.  The corresponding argument is <code>34</code> again, so
  once again a quotation mark is printed like this:
</p>
<pre><samp>"</samp></pre>
<p>
  Finally, the rest of the format string is copied unchanged to
  produce the following output:
</p>
<pre><samp>;printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp></pre>
<p>
  Here are all the five parts of the output presented next to each
  other:
</p>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s=</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>"</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>"</samp></pre>
<pre><samp>;printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp></pre>
<p>
  Writing them all out in a single line, we get this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34);}";printf(s,34,s,34);}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  This output matches the source code of the program thus confirming
  that our program is a quine.
</p>
<h2 id="classic-quine-with-terminating-newline">Classic Quine With Terminating Newline<a href="#classic-quine-with-terminating-newline"></a></h2>
<p>
  The source code of the classic quine presented above does not
  terminate with a newline.  I found that a little bothersome because
  I am used to always terminating my source code with a single
  trailing newline at the end.  So I decided to modify that quine a
  little to ensure that it always ends with a newline.  This is the
  quine I arrived at:
</p>
<pre><samp>main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34,10);}%c";printf(s,34,s,34,10);}</samp></pre>
<p>
  Compared to the quine in the previous sections, this one has an
  additional <code>%c</code> at the end of the formal string and the
  integer <code>10</code> as the corresponding argument to ensure that
  the output ends with a newline.  Here is a demonstration of this
  quine:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>echo 'main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34,10);}%c";printf(s,34,s,34,10);}' &gt; quine.c</kbd>
$ <kbd>cc quine.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out &gt; out.txt &amp;&amp; diff quine.c out.txt</kbd>
$ <kbd>cat quine.c</kbd>
main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34,10);}%c";printf(s,34,s,34,10);}
$ <kbd>./a.out</kbd>
main(){char*s="main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,34,s,34,10);}%c";printf(s,34,s,34,10);}</samp>
</pre>
<h2 id="c89-quine">C89 Quine<a href="#c89-quine"></a></h2>
<p>
  The classic C quines presented above are written in K&amp;C.  They
  do not conform to the C standard.  However, with some modifications
  to the quines presented above, we can get a quine that conforms to
  the C89 standard:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){char*s="#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;%cint main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}%c";printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a demonstration of this quine:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>echo '#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){char*s="#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;%cint main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}%c";printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}' &gt; quine.c</kbd>
$ <kbd>cc -std=c89 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic quine.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out &gt; out.txt &amp;&amp; diff quine.c out.txt</kbd>
$ <kbd>cat quine.c</kbd>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){char*s="#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;%cint main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}%c";printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}
$ <kbd>./a.out</kbd>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(){char*s="#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;%cint main(){char*s=%c%s%c;printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}%c";printf(s,10,34,s,34,10);return 0;}</samp>
