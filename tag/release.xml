<title>MathB 1.3.0</title>
<link>https://susam.net/code/news/mathb/1.3.0.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  MathB 1.3.0 is likely the final update of MathB, a web-based
  mathematics pastebin service.  The online mathematics pastebin
  service previously hosted at <code>https://mathb.in/</code> has been
  shut down today after 13 years of continuous service.  See the post
  <a href="../../../mathbin-is-shutting-down.html">MathB.in Is
  Shutting Down</a> for more details about this.  This release
  captures the state of this project as it was today at the time of
  shutting down the online service.
</p>
<p>
  This update includes a few new features.  For example, there is now
  a configurable runtime property named <code>:expect</code> that can
  be used to enforce the presence of certain tokens in the posts
  submitted by the users.  This feature was used to enforce the
  presence of LaTeX delimiters in the online service, a measure that
  was instrumental in reducing spam to a great extent in the last few
  years.  There are a few other minor changes too.
  See <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb/blob/main/CHANGES.md">CHANGES.md</a>
  for a detailed changelog.
</p>
<p>
  The source code of MathB remains free and open-source, so anyone
  interested in hosting their own instance can still do so.  To access
  the source code of MathB, please visit
  <a href="http://github.com/susam/mathb">github.com/susam/mathb</a>.

<title>FXYT 0.5.0</title>
<link>https://susam.net/code/news/fxyt/0.5.0.html</link>

<p>
  FXYT 0.5.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, esoteric, stack-based,
  postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36 simple commands.
  This release fixes an annoying bug that has been affecting some
  mobile device users for a while.  On some mobile web browsers, such
  as Chrome on Samsung Galaxy S8, the drawing canvas would appear to
  be larger than the viewport thus overflowing the visible screen on
  the mobile device.  The user would then be required to manually zoom
  out in order to use this tool conveniently.  This issue has been
  fixed in this release.
</p>
<p>
  If you follow my <a href="../../../cfrs.html">CFRS[]</a> project,
  you might have noticed yesterday that a very similar fix has gone
  into CFRS[] too.  For more details about that, see
  the release page for <a href="../cfrs/0.3.0.html">CFRS[] 0.3.0</a>.

<p>
  FXYT 0.4.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, esoteric, stack-based,
  postfix, canvas colouring language with only 36 simple commands.
  This release increases the maximum allowed code length from 256
  bytes to 1024 bytes.  This means there is now more room for writing
  more complex FXYT programs!
</p>
<p>
  Further, the maximum code length for distributable demo links has
  been increased from 64 bytes to 256 bytes.  This allows several more
  impressive demos to have their own distributable links.  As a
  specific example of one such demo, take a look at
  this <a href="https://susam.net/fxyt.html#XTsN128dN3142pN128qDN3142gbN6284dcDN1571gbN3142SdcDNN1571dlbNN3142dSdcDDN166SDpN120000qdSDpN1000qpN1000qN1000SdpN1000qN1100sN3pN25qYgNSbPN255c">animated

<p>
  <a href="../../../myrgb.html">Guess My RGB</a>, the little colour
  guessing game, just got a small update.  This update adds a
  "Mode" link to the footer which can be used to toggle the game
  between normal mode and expert mode.
</p>
<p>
  The expert mode was introduced as a hidden feature five months ago
  in the <a href="0.2.0.html">previous release</a>.  With the current
  release, the expert mode no longer remains a hidden feature.  You
  can simply toggle between modes via the new footer link.

  CFRS[] 0.2.0 is a minor update of CFRS[], an extremely minimal
  drawing language consisting of only 6 simple commands.  This update
  brings minor changes to the built-in help screen that can be invoked
  by typing <code>?</code> in the input pane.  For example, the help
  screen now has a direct links to built-in demos and community demos.
  Further, based on community feedback, the description of
  the <code>]</code> command has been updated with clearer language
  that better clarifies that this command repeats a repeatable block
  once (i.e. executes the repeatable block again).  See
  the <a href="https://github.com/susam/cfrs/blob/main/CHANGES.md">changelog</a>
  for more details.

<title>Guess My RGB 0.1.0</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Guess My RGB 0.1.0 is the first stable release
  of <a href="../../../myrgb.html">this tiny colour guessing game</a>.
  The game is available as a single HTML page that runs in a web
  browser.  It presents a page with a randomly chosen background
  colour.  The player then needs to guess the three RGB hexademical
  digits that make the given background colour.  See
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/myrgb">github.com/susam/myrgb</a>
  for more information about this game.
</p>
<p>
  I wrote this game last Saturday afternoon and shared it on my
  website at <a href="../../../myrgb.html">myrgb.html</a> later that
  night.  I had no intention of sharing this with a wide audience yet
  because I had not had sufficient time testing it well.  But somehow
  a Hacker News (HN) user named <em>talonx</em> discovered this game
  on Sunday morning and shared it on HN in this post:
  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018">news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39882018</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Since I had not shared this game with anyone anywhere yet, I was
  quite surprised to wake up Sunday morning and find my game trending
  at the top of HN.  I believe this is where maintaining an RSS feed
  on my website might have helped.  Every new page that I publish on
  this website also appears as an entry in the RSS feed for this
  website.  This feed can be found
  here: <a href="../../../feed.xml">feed.xml</a>.  I have a couple of
  hundred subscribers to this feed.  It is very likely that the HN
  user who shared this game on HN found it through this feed.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since this game was shared on HN, my website has received a
  large number of hits.  In the last three days (excluding today),
  this game has received a total of 166102 hits.  The actual numbers
  for each day look like this:
</p>
<table class="grid center textcenter">
  <tr>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Hits</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>31 Mar 2024</td>
    <td>95467</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>01 Mar 2024</td>
    <td>48330</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>02 Mar 2024</td>
    <td>22305</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  To all visitors of this website who played this game and shared this
  game with others, thank you!  Crafting tiny software tools like this
  is a creative outlet for me.  To know that there are others out
  there who enjoyed this game brings me joy!
</p>
<p>
  To play this game, go to <a href="../../../myrgb.html">myrgb.html</a>
  now and guess some colours!

<![CDATA[
<p>
  FXYT 0.2.0 is a minor update of FXYT, a tiny, stack-oriented, canvas
  colouring language written in postfix notation with only 36 simple
  commands.  This update specifies and implements a much stricter
  definition of the <code>F</code> command that sets the frame
  interval.  The problem with the earlier definition as well as
  implementation was that the <code>F</code> command was evaluated for
  every cell in the canvas and the frame interval was set for every
  such interval.  This meant that the frame interval that would be set
  for the next frame would depend on the order in which the evaluation
  occurred.  See section
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/fxyt#frame-interval">Frame
  Interval</a> of the README for the complete details.
</p>
<p>
  This update now ensures that a coordinate-dependent frame interval
  set with the <code>F</code> command behaves uniformly across any
  implementation of FXYT regardless of the order of evaluation.  This
  is done by ensuring that while the command <code>F</code> is
  evaluated for all cells, it is only the frame interval value found
  during the evaluation of cell (0, 0) that is honoured as the frame
  interval for the next frame.
</p>
<p>
  The new update is now available at
  <a href="../../../fxyt.html">fxyt.html</a>.  You are very welcome to
  try it out and play with it.  If you come up with any interesting
  demos, please do

<p>
  FXYT 0.1.0 is the first release of this project that introduces the
  FXYT canvas colouring language and a reference implementation.  This
  project is inspired by Martin Kleppe's very popular Tixy project.
  While Tixy supports JavaScript expressions to determine the size and
  colour of circles in a 16x16 grid, FXYT comes with its own tiny,
  stack-based language that is written in postfix notation.  Further,
  FXYT provides a 256x256 grid of cells each of which can be painted
  with an arbitrary colour determined by the result of the evaluation
  of the input code.

  MathB 1.2.0 is a minor update of MathB, a web-based mathematics
  pastebin service.
</p>
<p>
  This release introduces a number of new customisable properties,
  including the ability to set a minimum title length, minimum code
  length, etc.  The stylesheet for rendered pages has been improved so
  that the print preview displays only the rendered mathematical
  content, allowing users to print beautifully rendered pages to
  paper.  A few rendering bug fixes are included too.
</p>

<p>
  MathB 1.0.0 is the first major release of MathB since 2012, bringing
  significant updates to this web-based mathematics pastebin service.
</p>
<p>
  The most notable change is a complete rewrite in Common Lisp,
  replacing the original PHP codebase.  This shift reflects my
  preference for Lisp, a language I truly enjoy.  It also makes the
  project easier for me to maintain actively.
</p>
<p>
  This release introduces the use of the
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a> parser to
  robustly parse and render posts written using Markdown and LaTeX.
  Further, now there is support for dark colour scheme for systems
  that have dark colour scheme enabled.  For those who host this
  service on their web servers, MathB now supports a runtime control
  file named <code>opt.lisp</code> where a number of properties of
  this service can be customised.  These customisable properties
  include maximum title length, maximum code length, minimum time
  interval between two posts, etc.  See
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb/blob/main/CHANGES.md">CHANGES.md</a>
  for a detailed changelog.

  MathB 0.2.0 is a minor update of MathB, a web-based mathematics
  pastebin service.  The key change in this release is the removal of
  image support.  Image tags are now disallowed in new posts and older
  posts containing images will no longer be rendered.  This update
  aims to mitigate spam on the live service
  at <code>https://mathb.in/</code>.
