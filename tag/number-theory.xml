<![CDATA[
<p>
  I recently completed reading the book <em>Introduction to Analytic
  Number Theory</em> written by Tom M. Apostol and published in 1976.
  It is a fantastic book that takes us through a breathtaking journey
  of analytic number theory.  The journey begins with simple
  properties of divisibility and ends with integer partitions.  During
  this journey, we learn about several fascinating concepts such as
  the M&ouml;bius function, Dirichlet multiplication, Chebyshev's
  functions, Dirichlet characters, quadratic residues, the Riemann
  zeta function, etc.  An analytic proof of the prime number theorem
  is also presented in the book.
</p>
<p>
  One of the things about the book that caught my interest from the
  very beginning was its front cover.  It has a peculiarly drawn grid
  of white boxes and red empty regions that looks quite interesting.
  Here is the grid from the front cover of the book:
</p>
<figure>

      alt="A diagram of a grid with cells and empty region"></a>
  <figcaption>
    Diagram of a grid on the front cover of the book <em>Introduction
    to Analytic Number Theory</em>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Can we come up with a simple and elegant rule that defines this
  grid?  Here is one I could come up with:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <em>
    Number the columns in the grid 0, 1, 2 and so on from left to
    right.  Number the rows in the grid 0, 1, 2 and so on from bottom
    to top.  Let \( (x, y) \) represent the cell at column \( x \) and
    row \( y.  \)  Then a box exists at \( (x, y) \) if and only if \(
    \gcd(x, y) \ne 1.  \)
  </em>
</div>
<p>
  We define \( \gcd(x, y) \) to be a nonnegative common divisor of \(
  x \) and \( y \) such that every common divisor of \( x \) and
  \( y \) also divides \( \gcd(x, y).  \)  Let us now see if we can
  explain some of the interesting properties of this grid using the
  above rule:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      When \( x = 0 \) and \( y \ne 1, \) we get \( \gcd(x, y) =
      \lvert y \rvert \ne 1, \) so the entire column at \( x = 0 \)
      has boxes except at \( (0, 1).  \)  Similarly, the entire row at
      \( y = 0 \) has boxes except at \( (1, 0).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The cell \( (0, 0) \) has a box because \( \gcd(0, 0) \ne 1.  \)
      In fact, \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0.  \)  This follows from the definition
      of the \( \gcd \) function.  We will discuss this in more detail
      later in this post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every diagonal cell \( (x, x) \) has a box except at
      \( (1, 1) \) because \( \gcd(x, x) = \lvert x \rvert \) for all
      integers \( x.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The grid is symmetric about the diagonal cells \( (x, x) \)
      because \( \gcd(x, y) = \gcd(y, x).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A column at \( x \) has exactly one cell below the diagonal if
      and only if \( x \) is prime.  For example, check the column for
      \( x = 5.  \)  It has exactly one cell below the diagonal.  We
      know that \( 5 \) is prime.  Now check the column for
      \( x = 6.  \)  It has four cells below the diagonal.  We know
      that \( 6 \) is not prime.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Let us now elaborate the second point in the list above.  If \(
  \gcd(0, 0) \) is \( 0, \) then \( 0 \) must divide \( 0.  \)  Does \(
  0 \) really divide \( 0?  \)  Isn't \( 0/0 \) undefined?  Yes, even
  though \( 0/0 \) is undefined, \( 0 \) divides \( 0.  \)  We say an
  integer \( d \) divides an integer \( n \) when \( n = cd \) for
  some integer \( c.  \)  We have \( 0 = 0 \cdot 0, \) so indeed
  \( 0 \) divides \( 0.  \)
</p>
<p>
  We have shown that \( 0 \) divides \( 0 \) but we have not shown yet
  that \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0.  \)  Is \( \gcd(0, 0) \) really \( 0?  \)
  Every integer divides \( 0, \) e.g. \( 1 \) divdes \( 0, \) \( 2 \)
  divides \( 0, \) \( 3 \) divides \( 0, \) etc.  There does not seem
  to be a greatest common divisor of \( 0 \) and \( 0.  \)  Shouldn't
  \( \gcd(0, 0) \) be called either infinity or undefined?  No, we
  need to look at the definition of \( \gcd \) introduced earlier.  As
  per the definition, every common divisor of integers \( x \) and \(
  y \) must also divide \( \gcd(x, y).  \)  With this requirement in
  mind, we see that \( \gcd(0, 0) \) must be \( 0.  \)  This definition
  also makes \( \gcd(n, 0) = \gcd(0, n) = \lvert n \rvert \) for all
  integers \( n.  \)  Further, this definition makes B&eacute;zout's
  identity hold for all integers.  B&eacute;zout's identity states
  that there exists integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( mx + ny
  = \gcd(x, y).  \)  Indeed if we have \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0, \) we get \(
  0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0 = 0 = \gcd(0, 0).  \)
</p>
<p>
  That's all I wanted to share about the front cover of the book.
  While the front cover is quite interesting, the content of the book
  is even more fascinating.  I found chapters 12 and 13 of the book to
  be the most interesting.  In chapter 12, the book teaches how to
  prove that the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \) vanishes at
  every negative even integer \( s.  \)  Through several contour
  integrals and clever use of Cauchy's residue theorem, it shows in
  the end that \( \zeta(-2n) = 0 \) for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \dots.  \)  In
  chapter 13, the book shows us how to obtain zero-free regions where
  \( \zeta(s) \) does not vanish.  The book exposes various subtle
  nuances of the zeta function with great rigour and thoroughness.
  Results like \( \zeta(-1) = -1/12 \) that once felt mysterious look
  crystal clear and obvious after working through this book.  I
  strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn analytic
  number theory.

<title>Final IANT Meeting Today</title>

<![CDATA[
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>
  We have been reading the book <em>Introduction to Analytic Number
  Theory</em> by Apostol (1976) since March 2021.  It has been going
  consistently since then and the previous few posts on this blog
  provide an account of how this journey has been so far.  After about
  seven months of reading this book together, we are having our final
  meeting for this book today.  This is going to be
  the <a href="cc/iant/log.html#120">120th meeting</a> of our book
  discussion group.  The meeting notes from all previous reading
  sessions are archived at
  <a href="cc/iant/">IANT Notes</a>.  We will discuss the
  final two pages of this book today and complete reading this book.
</p>
<p>
  In the meeting today, we will look at some applications of the
  recursion formula related to partition functions that we learnt
  earlier.  Here is an excerpt from the book that shows a specific
  example that demonstrates the richness and beauty of concepts one
  can discover while studying analytic number theory:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Equation (24) becomes

  \[
  np(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma(k) p(n - k).
  \]

  a remarkable relation connecting a function of multiplicative number
  theory with one of additive number theory.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Now what equation (24) contains is not important for this post.  Of
  course, you can refer to the book if you really want to know what
  equation (24) is.  We learnt to prove that equation in the
  penultimate meeting for this subject yesterday.  In this post, I
  will emphasise how indeed this equation is remarkable.
</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="divisor-sum-function">The Divisor Sum Function<a href="#divisor-sum-function"></a></h2>
<p>
  The divisor sum function \( \sigma(n) \) represents the sum of all
  positive divisors of \( n.  \)  Here are some examples:

  \begin{align*}
  \sigma(1) &amp;= 1, \\
  \sigma(2) &amp;= 1 + 2 = 3, \\
  \sigma(3) &amp;= 1 + 3 = 4, \\
  \sigma(4) &amp;= 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, \\
  \sigma(5) &amp;= 1 + 5 = 6.
  \end{align*}

  We have spent a good amount of time with this function in the
  initial chapters of the book.  However, for the purpose of this blog
  post, the definition and the examples above are good enough.
</p>
<h2 id="unrestricted-partition-function">The Unrestricted Partition Function<a href="#unrestricted-partition-function"></a></h2>
<p>
  The \( p(n) \) function is the unrestricted partition function.  It
  represents the number of ways \( n \) can be written as a sum of
  positive integers \( \le n.  \)  Further, we let \( p(0) = 1.  \)
  Here are some examples:

  \begin{align*}
  p(1) &amp;= 1, \\
  p(2) &amp;= 2, \\
  p(3) &amp;= 3, \\
  p(4) &amp;= 4, \\
  p(5) &amp;= 7.
  \end{align*}

  Let me illustration the last value.  The integer \( 5 \) can be
  represented as a sum of positive integers \( \le 5 \) in 7 different
  ways.  They are: \( 5, \) \( 4 + 1, \) \( 3 + 2, \) \( 3 + 1 + 1, \)
  \( 2 + 2 + 1, \) \( 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 \) and \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.  \)
  Thus \( p(n) = 5.  \)
</p>
<h2 id="linkage-of-two-theorems">The Linkage of Two Theories<a href="#linkage-of-two-theorems"></a></h2>
<p>
  The divisor sum function comes from multiplicative number theory.
  The partition function comes from additive number theory.  Yet these
  two very different things get linked together in the formula
  mentioned in the excerpt included above.  Here is the formula once
  again:

  \[
    np(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \sigma(k) p(n - k).
  \]

  How beautiful!  How nicely the divisor sum function and the
  unrestricted partition function appear together elegantly in a
  single equation!  Further, this equation provides a recursion
  formula for the partition function.

  Here is an illustration of this equation with \( n = 5 \):

  \[
    5 \cdot p(5) = 5 \cdot 7 = 35.
  \]

  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^5 \sigma(k) p(5 - k)
    &amp;= \sigma(1) p(4) + \sigma(2) p(3) + \sigma(3) p(2) + \sigma(4) p(1) + \sigma(5) p(0) \\
    &amp;= (1)(5) + (3)(3) + (4)(2) + (7)(1) + (6)(1) \\
    &amp;= 5 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 \\
    &amp;= 35.
  \end{align*}

  We will go through this topic once more in the meeting today, so if
  you are interested to see this formula worked out in a step-by-step
  manner, do join our final meeting for this book.
</p>
<h2 id="final-meeting">The Final Meeting<a href="#final-meeting"></a></h2>
<p>
  The final meeting is coming up at 17:00 UTC today.  Visit
  the <a href="cc/iant/">analytic number theory page</a> to
  get the meeting link.  This is not going to be the final meeting for
  our overall book discussion group though.  This is going to be the
  finally meeting for only the analytic number theory book.  We will
  have more meetings for another book after a short break.
</p>
<p>
  The meeting today is going to be a lightweight session.  The last
  two pages that we will discuss today contain some examples of
  recursion formulas and some commentary about Ramanujan's partition
  identities.  Most of it should make sense even to those who have not
  been part of our meetings earlier, so everyone is welcome to join
  this meeting today, even if only to lurk.  You can also join our
  group by joining our IRC channel where we will publish updates about
  future meetings.  Our channel details are available in the
  <a href="cc/#join">main page here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks!<a href="#thanks"></a></h2>
<p>
  A big thank you to the Hacker News community and the Libera IRC
  mathematics and algorithms communities who showed interest in these
  meetings, joined the meetings and made this series of meetings
  successful.

<title>Journey to Integer Partitions</title>
<link>https://susam.net/journey-to-integer-partitions.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>
  After <a href="cc/iant/log.html#114">114 meetings</a> and 75 hours
  of studying together, our analytic number theory book discussion
  group has finally reached the final chapter of the
  book <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> by Apostol
  (1976).  We have less than 18 pages to read in order to complete
  reading this book.  Considering that we meet 3-4 times in a week and
  we discuss about 2-3 pages in every meeting, it appears that we
  would be able to complete reading this book in another 2 weeks.
</p>
<p>
  Reading this book has been quite a journey!  The previous three
  posts on this blog provide an account of how this journey has been.
  It has been fun, of course.  The best part of hosting a book
  discussion group like this has been the number of extremely smart
  people I got an opportunity to meet and interact with.  The insights
  and comments on the study material that others shared during the
  meetings were very helpful.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="cc/iant/log.html">meeting log</a> shows that our
  meetings started really small with only 4 participants in the first
  meeting in March 2021 and then it gradually grew to about 10-12
  regular members within a month.  Then a few months later, the number
  of participants began dwindling a little.  This happened because
  some members of the group had to drop out as they got busy with
  other personal or professional engagements.  However, six months
  later, we still have about 4-5 regular participants meeting
  consistently.  I think it is pretty good that we have made it this
  far.
</p>
<h2 id="unrestricted-partitions">Unrestricted Partitions<a href="#unrestricted-partitions"></a></h2>
<p>
  The final chapter on integer partitions is very unlike all the
  previous 12 chapters.  While the previous chapters dealt
  with <em>multiplicative number theory</em>, this final chapter deals
  with <em>additive number theory</em>.  For example, the first
  theorem talks about an interesting property of <em>unrestricted
  partitions</em>.  We study the number of ways a positive integer can
  be expressed as a sum of positive integers.  The number of summands
  is unrestricted, repetition of summands is allowed and the order of
  the summands is not taken into account.  For example, the number 3
  has 3 partitions: 3, 2 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1.  Similarly, the number 4
  has 5 partitions: 4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.
</p>
<p>
  I have always wanted to learn about partitions more deeply, so I am
  quite happy that this book ends with a chapter on partitions.  The
  subject of partitions is rich with very interesting results obtained
  by various accomplished mathematicians.  In the book, the first
  theorem about partitions is a very simple one that follows from the
  geometric representation of partitions.  Let us see an illustration
  first.
</p>
<p>
  How many partitions of 6 are there?  There are 11 partitions of 6.
  They are 6, 5 + 1, 4 + 2, 4 + 1 + 1, 3 + 3, 3 + 2 + 1, 3 + 1 + 1 +
  1, 2 + 2 + 2, 2 + 2 + 1 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
  + 1.  Now how many of these partitions are made up of 5 parts?  Each
  summand is called a part.  The answer is 2.  There are 2 partitions
  of 6 that are made up of 5 parts.  They are 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 2 + 2
  + 1 + 1.  Let us represent both these partitions as arrangements of
  lattice points.  Here is the representation of the partition 3 + 1 +
  1 + 1:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&bull; &bull; &bull;
&bull;
&bull;
&bull;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now if we read this arrangement from left to right, column by
  column, we get another partition of 6, i.e. 4 + 1 + 1.  Note that
  the number of parts in 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 (i.e. 4) appears as the largest
  part in 4 + 1 + 1.  Similarly, the number of parts in 4 + 1 + 1
  (i.e. 3) appears as the largest part in 3 + 1 + 1 + 1.  Let us see
  one more example of this relationship.  Here is the geometric
  representation of 2 + 2 + 1 + 1:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&bull; &bull;
&bull; &bull;
&bull;
&bull;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Once again, reading this representation from left to right, we get 4
  + 2, another partition of 6.  Once again, we can see that the number
  of partitions in 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 (i.e. 4) appears as the largest part
  in 4 + 2 and vice versa.  These observations lead to the first
  theorem in the chapter on partitions:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Theorem 14.1</strong>
  <em>
    The number ofpartitions of \( n \)
    into \( m \) parts is equal to the number of partitions of \( n \)
    into parts, the largest of which is \( m.  \)
  </em>
</blockquote>
<p>
  That was a brief introduction to the chapter on partitions.  In the
  next two or so weeks, we will dive deeper into the theory of
  partitions.
</p>
<h2 id="next-meeting">Next Meeting<a href="#next-meeting"></a></h2>
<p>
  If this blog post was fun for you, consider joining our next
  meeting.  Our next meeting is on Tue, 21 Sep 2021 at 17:00 UTC.
  Since we are at the beginning of a new chapter, it is a good time
  for new participants to join us.  It is also a good time for members
  who have been away for a while to join us back.  Since this chapter
  does not depend much on the previous chapters, new participants
  should be able to join our reading sessions for this chapter and
  follow along easily without too much effort.

</p>
<p>
  It is worth mentioning here that lurking is absolutely fine in our
  meetings.  In fact, most participants of our meetings join in and
  stay silent throughout the meeting.  Only a few members talk via
  audio/video or chat.  This is considered absolutely normal in our
  meetings, so please do not hesitate to join our meetings!

<![CDATA[
<p>
  How long does it take to start with zero knowledge of analytic
  number theory and successfully learn the analytic proof of the prime
  number theorem?  Take a guess!  I will share my answer in the next
  two paragraphs.  This is something I had wondered when we began our
  analytic number theory book discussion group in March 2021.  Back
  then, I thought it would take at least 100 hours of effort.
</p>
<p>
  The book I had chosen for our discussions was <em>Introduction to
  Analytic Number Theory</em> by Apostol (1976).  I have been hosting
  40-minute meetings for about 3-4 days every week since March 2021.
  We discuss a couple of pages of the book in every meeting.  Most
  participants in this meeting are from Hacker News and Libera IRC
  network.  For a long time, I was eager to learn the proof of the
  prime number theorem.  For those unfamiliar with the theorem, I will
  describe it briefly in further sections.  Let me first answer the
  question I asked in the previous paragraph.
</p>
<p>
  So how long does it take to start with no knolwedge of analytic
  number theory and teach ourselves the analytic proof of the prime
  number theorem?  Turns out, it takes 72 hours!  It took our group 72
  hours spread across <a href="cc/iant/log.html#110">110 meetings</a>
  over 6 months to be able to understand the proof.  It is worth
  noting here that most of us in this group have full-time jobs and
  other personal obligations!  We were all doing this for fun, for the
  joy of learning!
</p>
<p>
  Now I must mention that the 72 hours noted above is only the time
  spent together in reading the book and working through the theorems
  and proofs.  It does not include the personal time spent in solving
  problems, reading some sections again, taking notes, etc.  All of
  that was done in our personal time.  We did discuss the solutions to
  some of the very interesting problems in our meetings just to take a
  break from the theorem-and-proof style of reading but most of these
  72 hours of meetings focussed on working through the theorems and
  proofs in the book.
</p>
<p>
  It may be possible to achieve this milestone in lesser number of
  hours, perhaps by reading the book alone which for some folks might
  be faster than studying in a group or perhaps by skipping some
  chapters for topics that look very familiar.  In our discussions,
  however, we did not skip any chapter.  There were in fact a few
  chapters we could have skipped.  All members of these meetings were
  very familiar with divisibility, greatest common divisor, the
  fundamental theorem of arithmetic, etc. discussed in Chapter 1.
  Most of us were also very familiar with the concepts discussed in
  Chapter 5 such as congruences, residue classes, the Euler-Fermat
  theorem, the Chinese remainder theorem, etc.  Despite being familiar
  with these concepts, we decided not to skip any chapter for the sake
  of completeness of our coverage of the material.  In fact, we read
  every single line of the book and deliberated over every single
  concept discussed in the book.  With this detailed and tedious
  approach to reading the book, it took us 72 hours to read about 290
  pages and learn the analytic proof of the prime number theorem in
  Chapter 13.

<h2 id="prime-number-theorem">Prime Number Theorem<a href="#prime-number-theorem"></a></h2>
<p>
  The prime number theorem is a very curious fact about the
  distribution of prime numbers that Gauss noticed in the year 1792
  when he was about 15 years old.  He noticed that the occurrence of
  primes become rarer and rarer as we expand our search for them to
  larger and larger integers.  For example, there are 4 primes between
  1 and 10, i.e. 40% of the numbers between 1 and 10 are primes!  But
  there are only 25 primes between 1 and 100, i.e. only 25% of the
  numbers between 1 and 100 are primes.  If we go up to 1000, we
  notice that there are only 168 primes between 1 and 1000, i.e. only
  16.8% of the numbers between 1 and 1000 are primes.  Formally, we
  denote these facts with the mathematical notation \( \pi(x) \) that
  denotes the prime counting function.  We say \( \pi(10) = 4, \) \(
  \pi(100) = 25, \) \( \pi(1000) = 168 \) and so on.  Note that we
  allow \( x \) to be a real number, so while \( \pi(10) = 4, \) we
  have \( \pi(10.3) = 4 \) as well.  One of the reasons we let \( x \)
  be a real number in the definition of \( \pi(x) \) is because it
  makes various problems we come across during the study of this
  function more convenient to work on using real analysis.
</p>
<p>
  We observe that the 'density' of primes continue to fall as we make
  \( x \) larger and larger.  In formal notation, we see that the
  ratio \( \pi(x) / x \) is \( 0.4 \) when \( x = 10.  \)  This ratio
  falls to \( 0.25 \) when \( x = 100.  \)  It falls further to \(
  0.168 \) when \( x = 1000 \) and so on.  Can we predict by how much
  this "density" falls?  The answer is yes.  That leads us to the
  prime number theorem.  The prime number theorem states that \(
  \pi(x) / x \) is asymptotic to \( 1 / \log x \) as \( x \)
  approaches infinity, i.e.

  \[
    \frac{\pi(x)}{x} \sim \frac{1}{\log x} \text{ as } x \to \infty.
  \]

  For those unfamiliar with the notation of asymptotic equality, here
  is another equivalent way to state the above relationship,

  \[
    \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\pi(x) / x}{1 / \log x} = 1.
  \]

  We could also write this as

  \[
    \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\pi(x)}{x / \log x} = 1
  \]

  or

  \[
    \pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x} \text{ as } x \to \infty.
  \]

  Let us see how well this formula works as an estimate for the
  density of primes for small values of \( x.  \)
</p>
<table style="text-align: right" class="grid center">
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: right">\( x \)</th>
    <th style="text-align: right">\( \pi(x) \)</th>

<p>
  Not bad!  In fact, the last two columns begin to agree more and more
  as \( x \) becomes larger and larger.

  The analytic proof of the prime number theorem was achieved with an
  intricate chain of equivalences and implications between various
  theorems.  The book consumes 13 chapters and 290 pages before
  completing the proof of the prime number theorem.  Each page is also
  quite dense with information.  The amount of commentary or
  illustrations is very little in the book.  Most of the book keeps
  alternating between theorem statements and proofs.  Occasionally,
  for especially long chapters with an intricate sequence of proofs,
  Apostol provides a plan of the proof in the introductions to such
  chapters.  It is quite hard to summarise a large and dense volume of
  work like this in a blog post but I will make an attempt to paint a
  very high-level picture of some of the key concepts that are
  involved in the proof.
</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">Equivalent Forms<a href="#the-basics"></a></h2>
<p>
  Everything from Chapters 1 to 3 is about building basic concepts and
  tools we will use later to work on the problem of the prime number
  theorem.  These concepts and tools were very interesting on their
  own.  They involved divisibility, various number-theoretic
  functions, Dirichlet products, the big oh notation, etc.  Chapter 4
  was the first chapter where we engaged ourselves with the prime
  number theorem.  This chapter taught us several other formulas that
  were logically equivalent to the prime number theorem.  One
  equivalence that would play a big role later was the equivalence
  between the prime number theorem

  \[
    \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\pi(x) \log x}{x} = 1
  \]

  and the following form:

  \[
    \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\psi(x)}{x} = 1.
  \]

  If we could prove one, the validity of the other would be
  established automatically.  The notation \( \psi(x) \) denotes the
  Chebyshev function which in turn is defined in terms of the Mangoldt
  function \( \Lambda(n) \) as \( \psi(x) = \sum_{n \le x} \Lambda(n).  \)
  Note that the formula above can also be stated using the asymptotic
  equality notation as follows:

  \[
    \psi(x) \sim x \text{ as } x \to \infty.
  \]

  There were several other equivalent forms too shown in Chapter 4.
  The fact that all these various forms were equivalent to each other
  was rigorously proved in the chapter.  Thus proving any one of the
  equivalent forms would be sufficient to prove the prime number
  theorem.  But in Chapter 4, we did not know how to prove any of the
  equivalent forms.  We could only prove the equivalence of the
  various formulas, not the formulas themselves.  We only learnt that
  if any of the equivalent forms is true, so is the prime number
  theorem.  Similarly, if any of the equivalent forms is false, so is
  the prime number theorem.  We would visit the prime number theorem
  again in Chapter 13 which would complete the proof of the prime
  number theorem by showing that the equivalent form mentioned above
  is indeed true.
</p>
<h2 id="dirichlet-dirichlet-dirichlet">Dirichlet, Dirichlet, Dirichlet!<a href="#dirichlet-dirichlet-dirichlet"></a></h2>
<p>
  Chapters 5 to 10 introduced more concepts involving congruences,
  finite abelian groups, their characters, Dirichlet characters,
  Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions, Gauss
  sums, quadratic residues, primitive roots, etc.  Some of these
  concepts would turn out to be very important in proving the prime
  number theorem but most of them probably are not too important if
  understanding the proof of the prime number theorem is the only
  goal.  Regardless, all of these chapters were very interesting.
</p>
<p>
  It was in Chapters 11 and 12 that we felt that we were getting
  closer and closer to the proof of the prime number theorem.  Chapter
  11 began a detailed and rigorous study of convergence and divergence
  of Dirichlet series.  The Riemann zeta function is a specific type
  of Dirichlet series.  Chapter 12 introduced analytic continuation of
  the Riemann zeta function.  We could then show interesting results
  like \( \zeta(0) = -1/2 \) and \( \zeta(-1) = -1/12 \) using the
  analytic continuation of the zeta function.  This chapter also
  showed us why all trivial zeroes of \( \zeta(s) \) must lie at
  negative even integers.
</p>
<p>
  One thing I realised during the study of this book is how frequently
  we use concepts, operations, functions and theorems named after
  Dirichlet.  It was impossible to get through a meeting without
  having uttered "Dirichlet" at least a dozen times!
</p>
<h2 id="chain-of-proofs">Chain of Proofs<a href="#chain-of-proofs"></a></h2>
<p>
  Finally, Chapter 13 showed us how to prove the prime number theorem.
  The plan of the proof was laid out in the first section.  Our goal
  in this chapter is to prove that \( \psi(x) \sim x \) as \( x \to
  \infty.  \)  This is equivalent to the prime number theorem, so
  proving this amounts to proving the prime number theorem too.
</p>
<p>
  Next we learn that the asymptotic relation \( \psi_1(x) \sim x^2 / 2 \)
  as \( x \to \infty \) implies the previous asymptotic relationship.
  Here \( \psi_1(x) \) is defined as \( \psi_1(x) = \int_1^x \psi(t)
  \, dt.  \)  This implication is proved quite easily in one and a half
  pages.  But we still need to show that the asymptotic relation \(
  \psi_1(x) \sim x^2 / 2 \) as \( x \to \infty \) indeed holds good.
  Proving this takes a lot of work.  To prove this asymptotic relation
  we first learn to arrive at the following equation involving a
  contour integral:

  \[
    \frac{\psi_1(x)}{x^2} - \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{x} \right)^2
    = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c - \infty i}^{c + \infty i} \frac{x^{s - 1}}{s(s + 1)}
    \left( -\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} - \frac{1}{s - 1} \right) \, ds
  \]

  for \( c \gt 1.  \)  The equation above looks quite complex initially
  but each part of it becomes friendly as we learn to derive it and
  then work on each part of it while working out further proofs.  Now
  if we could somehow show that the integral on the right hand side of
  the above equation approaches 0 as \( x \to \infty, \) that would
  end up proving the asymptotic relation involving \( \psi_1(x) \) and
  thus end up proving the prime number theorem by equivalence.
  However, proving that this integral indeed becomes 0 as \( x \to
  \infty \) requires a careful study of \( \zeta(s)/\zeta'(s) \) in
  the vicinity of the line \( \operatorname{Re}(s) = 1.  \)  This is
  the topic that most of the chapter deals with.
</p>
<p>
  This plan of the proof looked quite convoluted initially but Apostol
  has done a great job in this chapter to first walk us through this
  plan and then prove each fact that we need to make the proof work in
  a detailed and rigorous manner.  When we reached the end of the
  proof, one of our regular members remarked, "Now the proof does not
  look so complex!"
</p>
<p>
  Would the elementary proof of the prime number theory have been
  easier?  I don't know.  I have not studied the elementary proof.
  But Apostol does say this at the beginning of Chapter 13,
</p>
<blockquote>
  The analytic proof is shorter than the elementary proof sketched in
  Chapter 4 and its principal ideas are easier to comprehend.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Learning the analytic proof itself was quite a long journey that
  required dedication and consistency in our studies over a period of
  6 months.  If we trust the above excerpt from the book, then I think
  it is fair to assume that the elementary proof is even more
  formidable.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  That was an account of our journey through an analytic number theory
  book from its first chapter up to the analytic proof of the prime
  number theorem.  We have not completed reading the entire book
  though.  We still have about another 30 pages to go through.  In the
  remaining study of this book, we will learn more about zero-free
  regions for \( \zeta(s), \) the application of the prime number
  theorem to the divisor function and the Euler totient function.  The
  next and the final chapter too has a lot to offer such as integer
  partition, Euler's pentagonal-number theorem and the partition
  identities of Ramanujan.  I am pretty hopeful that we will be
  complete reading this book in another few weeks of meetings.

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Today, our computation book discussion group is going to have the
  100th meeting!  Yes, <a href="cc/iant/log.html#100">the 100th
  meeting</a>!  We began these book discussion meetings about five
  months ago.  The first book we picked up for our discussions
  was <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> by Apostol
  (1976).  We have been reading this book together for the last five
  months.  We have a tiny but consistent community of 6 to 8
  participants who meet regularly to study this book and share our
  understanding and insights with each other.
</p>
<p>
  In this blog post, I will talk about my personal experience hosting
  these meetings and my personal journey about reading this book.  It
  is worth keeping in mind then that what I am about to write below
  may not have any resemblance with the experience of other
  participants of these meetings.

  As far as I know, everyone who joins our meetings are involved in
  computer programming in one form or another.  A few of them have
  very strong background in mathematics.  I host these meetings
  everyday and discuss a few sections of the book in detail.  I show
  how to work through the proofs, explain some of the steps, etc.
  Sometimes I get stuck in some step that I find too unobvious.
  Sometimes the steps are obvious but my brain is too slow to
  understand why the steps work.  But these tiny glitches have not
  been a problem so far, thanks to all the members who join these
  meetings on a daily basis and contribute their explanations of the
  proofs.
</p>
<p>
  I believe the group members are the best part of these discussions.
  Thanks to the insights and explanation of the reading material
  shared by all these members, I am fairly confident that we are able
  to take a close look at every proof and convince ourselves that
  every step of the proofs work.
</p>
<h2 id="the-learning-experience">The Learning Experience<a href="#the-learning-experience"></a></h2>
<p>
  The first web meeting to discuss the chosen analytic number theory
  book occurred on 5 Mar 2021.  See the blog
  post <a href="reading-classic-computation-books.html">Reading
  Classic Computation Books</a> to read about the early days of our
  group and how it was formed.  Back then, I knew little to nothing
  about analytic number theory.  Although I was familiar with some of
  the elementary concepts like divisibility, Euler's totient function,
  modular arithmetic, calculus and related theorems, chapter 2 of the
  book itself proved to be a significant challenge for me.  In the
  second chapter, it became clear to me that we will be building new
  levels of mathematical abstractions, use these abstractions to build
  yet another layer of abstractions and so on.  The chapter began with
  a description of the M&ouml;bius function, a very neat and
  interesting function that I was previously unaware of.  That was
  fun!  But soon, this chapter began adding new layers of abstractions
  such as Dirichlet product, Dirichlet inverse, generalised
  convolution, etc.  I could almost feel my brain stretching and
  growing as we went through each page of this chapter.
</p>
<p>
  I often saw that after I have learnt a new concept in a chapter, it
  would not become intuitive immediately.  I would understand the
  concepts, understand the related theorems, understand each step of
  the proofs, solve exercise problems, know how to apply the theorems
  when needed and yet I could not "feel" them.  I wanted to not just
  understand the concepts but I also wanted to "feel" the concepts
  like the way I could feel algebra, calculus, computer programming,
  etc.  In the initial days, I wondered if I was too old to develop
  good intuition for all these new and highly sophisticated concepts.
</p>
<p>
  Despite always feeling that all these concepts were too technical
  and quite unintuitive, I kept going.  I kept hosting these
  discussions with a frequency of about 3-5 days every week.  We
  continued discussing the various chapters and the proofs in them.
  And then suddenly one day while reading chapter 4, something
  interesting happened.  As we were employing Dirichlet products to
  obtain some useful results, I realised that the concept
  of <em>Dirichlet products</em> which once felt so foreign two
  chapters earlier, now felt completely intuitive.  I
  could <em>see</em> different functions being equivalent to Dirichlet
  products intuitively and effortlessly.  Dirichlet products felt no
  more alien than, say, arithmetic multiplication.  I could "feel" it
  now.  It was a great feeling.  I realised that sometimes it might
  take a few additional chapters of reading and using those concepts
  over and over again before they really begin to feel intuitive.
</p>
<h2 id="three-concepts">Three Concepts<a href="#three-concepts"></a></h2>
<p>
  In this section, I will pick three interesting concepts from
  different parts of the book to provide a glimpse of what the journey
  has been like.  These three things occur in the book again and again
  and play a very important role in several chapters of the book.  Of
  course, it goes without saying that there are many interesting
  concepts in the book and many of them may be more important than the
  ones I am about to show below.
</p>
<h3 id="the-mobius-function">The M&ouml;bius Function<a href="#the-mobius-function"></a></h3>
<p>
 For any positive integer \( n, \) the M&ouml;bius function \( \mu(n)
 \) is defined as follows:

 \[
   \mu(1) = 1;
 \]

 If \( n \gt 1, \) write \( n = p_1^{a_1} \dots p_k^{a_k} \) (prime
 factorisation).  Then

 \begin{align*}
   \mu(n) &amp; = (-1)^k \text{ if } a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_k = 1, \\
   \mu(n) &amp; = 0 \text{ otherwise}.
 \end{align*}

 If \( n \ge 1, \) we have

 \[
   \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) =
   \begin{cases}
   1 &amp; \text{ if } n = 1, \\
   0 &amp; \text{ if } n \gt 1.
   \end{cases}
 \]
</p>
<p>
  I was unfamiliar with this function prior to reading the book.  It
  felt like a nice little cute function initially but as we went
  through more chapters, it soon became clear that this function plays
  a major role in analytic number theory.
</p>
<p>
  As a simple example, we will soon see in this post that the Euler's
  totient function can be expressed as a Dirichlet product of the
  M&ouml;bius function and the arithmetical function \( N(n) = n.  \)
</p>
<p>
  As a more sophisticated example, the Dirichlet series with
  coefficients as the M&ouml;bius function is the multiplicative
  inverse of the Riemann zeta function, i.e. if \( s = \sigma + it \)
  is a complex number with its real part \( \sigma \gt 1, \) we have

  \[
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s} = \frac{1}{\zeta(s)}.
  \]

  This immediately shows that \( \zeta(s) \ne 0 \) for \( \sigma \gt
  1.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="dirichlet-product">Dirichlet Product<a href="#dirichlet-product"></a></h3>
<p>
  If \( f \) and \( g \) are two arithmetical functions, their
  Dirichlet product \( f * g \) is defined as:

  \[
    (f * g)(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} f(d) g\left( \frac{n}{d} \right).
  \]

  Dirichlet products appear to pop up magically at various places in
  number theory.  Here is a simple example:

  \[
    \varphi(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) \frac{n}{d}.
  \]

  Therefore in the notation of Dirichlet products, the above equation
  can also be written as

  \[
    \varphi = \mu * N
  \]

  where \( N \) represents the arithmetical function \( N(n) = n \)
  for all \( n.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="hurwitz-zeta-function">Hurwitz Zeta Function<a href="#hurwitz-zeta-function"></a></h3>
<p>
  For complex numbers \( s = \sigma + it, \) the Hurwitz zeta function
  \( \zeta(s, a) \) is initially defined for \( \sigma \gt 1 \) as

  \[
    \zeta(s, a) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(n + a)^s}
  \]

  where \( a \) is a fixed real number, \( 0 \lt a \lt 1.  \)  Then by
  analytic continuation, it is defined for \( \sigma \le 1 \) as

  \[
    \zeta(s, a) = \Gamma(1 - s)I(s, a)
  \]

  where \( \Gamma \) represents the gamma function

  \[
    \Gamma(s) =  \int_0^{\infty} x^{s - 1} e^{-x} \, dx
  \]

  defined for \( \sigma \gt 0 \) and also defined, by analytic
  continuation, for \( \sigma \le 0 \) except for \( \sigma = 0, -1,
  -2, \dots \) (the nonpositive integers) and \( I(s, a) \) is defined
  by the contour integral

  \[
    I(s, a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_C \frac{z^{s-1} e^{az}}{1 - e^z} \, dz
  \]

  where \( 0 \lt a \le 1 \) and the contour \( C \) is a loop around
  the negative real axis composed of three parts \( C_1, \) \( C_2 \)
  and \( C_3 \) such that for \( c \lt 2\pi, \) we have \( z =
  re^{-\pi i} \) on \( C_1 \) and \( z = re^{\pi i} \) on \( C_3 \) as
  \( r \) varies from \( c \) to \( +\infty \) and \( z = ce^{i
  \theta} \) on \( C_2, \) \( -\pi \le \theta \le \pi.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Now admittedly, the definition or the analytic continuation of
  Hurwitz zeta function may seem very heavy and obscure to the
  uninitiated and it <em>is</em> indeed quite heavy.  It takes 6 pages
  in chapter 12 to build the prerequisite concepts before we arrive at
  this definition.  It is evident that this definition uses other
  concepts like the gamma function, a specific contour integral, etc.
  and it is only natural to expect that one has to gain sufficient
  expertise with the gamma function and contour integrals before the
  Hurwitz zeta function begins to feel intuitive.
</p>
<p>
  But once we have established the analytic continuation of the
  Hurwitz zeta function, many insightful facts about the Riemann zeta
  function follow readily.  It is easy to see that the Riemann zeta
  function can be defined in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function as

  \[
    \zeta(s) = \zeta(s, 1) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}.
  \]

  Yes, the \( \zeta \) symbol is overloaded: \( \zeta(s, a) \) is the
  Hurwitz zeta function whereas \( \zeta(s) \) is the Riemann zeta
  function.  This relationship between the Riemann zeta function and
  the Hurwitz zeta function along with the analytic continuation of
  the Hurwitz zeta function opens new doors into the wonderful world
  of complex numbers and let us obtain beautiful and profound facts
  about the Riemann zeta function such as the fact that it has zeros
  at negative even integers, i.e. \( \zeta(n) = 0 \) for \( n = -2,
  -4, -6, \dots \) and the fact that \( \zeta(0) = -\frac{1}{2} \) and
  \( \zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12} \) and so on.
</p>
<p>
  I believe beautiful results like these obtained by digging deep into
  complex analysis are what makes the study of analytic number theory
  so rewarding.
</p>
<h2 id="the-next-meeting">The Next Meeting<a href="#the-next-meeting"></a></h2>
<p>
  The next meeting is coming up today in a few hours.  Are we planning
  anything special for the 100th meeting?
</p>
<p>
  I think the 100th meeting is a significant milestone in our journey
  of understanding the beautiful and interesting gems hidden away in
  the subject of analytic number theory.  This milestone has been
  possible only due to the sustained curiousity and eagerness among
  the members of the group to learn a significant area of mathematics
  and learn it well.  We have reached this milestone successfully due
  to the passion and love for mathematics that drive the regular
  members to join these meetings and go through a few pages of the
  book everyday.  In these meetings, we have read 12 chapters
  consisting of over 250 pages so far.  Many of us knew nothing about
  analytic number theory merely five months ago and now we can
  appreciate the Riemann zeta function at a deeper level.  We now
  understand what the Riemann hypothesis really means.  This has been
  a great journey so far.
</p>
<p>
  Despite being a significant milestone and cause for celebration, we
  are going to keep our 100th meeting fairly simple.  We will continue
  where we left off yesterday.  Today we have some more relationships
  between the gamma function and the Riemann zeta function to go
  through, so that is what we will do.  We will also show that \(
  \zeta(0) = -\frac{1}{2} \) and \( \zeta(-1) = -\frac{1}{12} \) using

<h3 id="main-idea-behind-the-proof-of-eulers-summation-formula">Main idea behind the proof of Euler's summation formula<a href="#main-idea-behind-the-proof-of-eulers-summation-formula"></a></h3>
<p>
  Important numbers in the proof:

  \[
    0, \quad
    \underbrace{[y]}_{=\,m}, \quad
    y, \quad
    \underbrace{[y] + 1}_{=\,m + 1}, \quad
    \underbrace{[x]}_{=\,k}, \quad
    x.
  \]

  Splitting the definite integral:

  \[
    \int_y^x f(t)\,dt
    = \int_{y}^{[y] + 1} f(t)\,dt
    + \underbrace{\int_{[y] + 1}^{[y] + 2} f(t)\,dt + \dots
    + \int_{[x] - 1}^{[x]} f(t)\,dt}_{=\,\int_{[y] + 1}^{[x]} f(t)\, dt}
    + \int_{[x]}^{x} f(t)\,dt.
  \]

  Using the more convenient variables \( m \) and \( k, \) we get:

  \[
    \int_y^x f(t)\,dt
    = \int_m^{m + 1} f(t)\,dt
    + \underbrace{\int_{m + 1}^{m + 2} f(t)\,dt + \dots
    + \int_{k - 1}^{k} f(t)\,dt}_{=\,\int_{m + 1}^{k} f(t)\, dt}
    + \int_{k}^{x} f(t)\,dt.

  Splitting definite integral:

  \begin{align*}
    &amp; \int_1^{\infty} f(t) \, dt = \int_1^{x} f(t) \, dt + \int_x^{\infty} f(t) \, dt \\
    &amp; \iff

  \end{align*}

  Solving improper integral:

  \[
    \int_x^{\infty} \frac{1}{t^2} \, dt
    = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_x^b \frac{1}{t^2} dt
    = \lim_{b \to \infty} \frac{-1}{t} \Biggr|_x^b
    = \left( \lim_{b \to \infty} \frac{-1}{b} \right) + \frac{1}{x}
    = 0 + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{x}.

<p>
  Definition of Euler's constant:

  \[
    C = \lim_{n \to \infty}
        \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \dots + \frac{1}{n} - \log n \right)
      = \lim_{x \to \infty} \left( \sum_{n \le x} \frac{1}{n} - \log x \right).
  \]

  We begin with

  \[
    \sum_{n \le x} \frac{1}{n}
    = \log x
    + \underbrace{1 - \int_1^{\infty} \frac{t - [t]}{t^2} \, dt}_{\text{We will show below that this is \( C \)}}
    + O\left( \frac{1}{x} \right).
  \]

  Rearranging the terms, we get

  \[
    \sum_{n \le x} \frac{1}{n} - \log x
    = 1 - \int_1^{\infty} \frac{t - [t]}{t^2} \, dt
    + O\left( \frac{1}{x} \right).
  \]

  Using the definition of \( C, \) we get

  \begin{align*}
    C
    &amp; = \lim_{x \to \infty}
            \left( \sum_{n \le x} \frac{1}{n} - \log x \right) \\
    &amp; = \lim_{x \to \infty}
            \left( 1 - \int_1^{\infty} \frac{t - [t]}{t^2} \, dt
                     + O\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) \\
    &amp; = 1 - \int_1^{\infty} \frac{t - [t]}{t^2} \, dt.

<h3 id="proof-of-theorem-2.18">Proof of Theorem 2.18<a href="#proof-of-theorem-2.18"></a></h3>
<p>
  Let \( f \) be multiplicative.  We want to show that

  \[
    \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) f(d) = \prod_{p \mid n} (1 - f(p)).
  \]

  Note the following:

  \[
    g(n)
    = \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) f(d)
    = \sum_{d \mid n} (\mu f) (d)
    u\left( \frac{n}{d} \right)
    = (\mu f) * u.
  \]

  The functions \( \mu \) and \( f \) are multiplicative.  Thus \( \mu
  f \) is multiplicative.  Thus \( (\mu f) * u \) is multiplicative.
  Therefore

  \[
    g(n) = g(p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \dots p_k^{a_k}) =
    g(p_1^{a_1}) g(p_2^{a_2}) \dots g(p_k^{a_k}).
  \]

  But

  \begin{align*}
    g(p_i^{a_i})
    &amp; = \sum_{d \mid p_i^{a_i}} \mu(d) f(d) \\
    &amp; = \mu(1) f(1) + \mu(p_i) f(p_i) +
             \underbrace{\mu(p_i^2) f(p_i^2) + \dots + \mu(p_i^{a_i}) f(p_i^{a_i})}_{=\,0} \\
    &amp; = 1 - f(p).
  \end{align*}

  From the two equations above, we get

  \begin{align*}
    g(n)
    &amp; = g(p_1^{a_1}) g(p_2^{a_2}) \dots g(p_k^{a_k}) \\
    &amp; = (1 - f(p_1)) (1 - f(p_2)) \dots (1 - f(p_k)) \\
    &amp; = \prod_{p \mid n} (1 - f(p)).

  Some steps of Example 1:

  \[
    I(n)= \mu^2(n) * \lambda(n)
    \implies I_p(x) = \mu_p^2(x) \lambda_p(x)
  \]

  \[
    I_p(x) = \mu_p^2(x) \lambda_p(x)
    \iff 1 = \mu_p^2(x) \cdot \frac{1}{1 + x}
    \iff \mu_p^2(x) = 1 + x.
  \]
</p>
<p>
  Some steps of Example 2:

  \begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{1 - p^{\alpha}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - x}
    &amp; = \frac{1}{1 - x - p^{\alpha}x + p^{\alpha}x^2} \\
    &amp; = \frac{1}{1 - (1 + p^{\alpha})x + p^{\alpha}x^2} \\
    &amp; = \frac{1}{1 - \sigma_{\alpha}(p)x + p^{\alpha}x^2}.
  \end{align*}

  Note that \( \sigma_{\alpha}(n) = \sum_{d\,\mid\,n} d^{\alpha}, \) so

  \[
    \sigma_{\alpha}(p)
    = \sum_{d\,\mid\,p} d^{\alpha}
    = 1^{\alpha} + p^{\alpha}
    = 1 + p^{\alpha}.
  \]
</p>
<p>
  Some steps of Example 3: Showing That \( f(n) = 2^{\nu(n)} \) is
  multiplicative:

  \[
    f(n) = 2^{\nu(n)}.
  \]

  \[
    f(p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \dots p_k^{\alpha_k})
    = 2^{\nu(p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \dots p_k^{\alpha_k})} = 2^k.
  \]

  \[
    f(p_1^{\alpha_1}) f(p_2^{\alpha_2}) \dots f(p_k^{\alpha_k})
    = 2^{\nu(p_1^{\alpha_1})} 2^{\nu(p_2^{\alpha_2})} \dots 2^{\nu(p_k^{\alpha_k})}
    = \underbrace{2 \cdot 2 \cdot \dots \cdot 2}_{k \text{ times}}.
    = 2^k.

<h1>Notes on Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</h1>
<p>
  This page contains an archive of notes from the book
  <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> by Tom M. Apostol
  (1976).
</p>
<p>
  Note that this set of notes is not meant to be a systematic
  exposition of analytic number theory.  Instead this is just a
  collection of examples that illustrate some of the theorems in the
  reference textbook and intermediate steps that are not explicitly
  expressed in the book.  These boards were used to aid the
  discussions during book discussion meetings.  As a result, the
  content of these boards is informal in nature and is not intended to
  be a substitute for the book or the actual discussion meetings.
</p>
<p>
  If you find any mistakes in the content of the board files, please

  issue</a> or <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net">send a

<p>
  The primary reference book for these meetings is
  <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom
  M. Apostol.  Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may
  find a relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some websites.
</p>
<p>
  These meetings are hosted by Susam and attended by some members of
  <code>#math</code> and <code>#algorithms</code> channels of Libera
  IRC network as well as by some members
  from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You are welcome to join these meetings anytime.  If you are
  concerned that the meetings may not make sense if you join when we
  are in the middle of a chapter, please free to talk to us about it
  in the <a href="../#join">group channel</a>.  I can
  recommend the next best time to begin joining the meetings.
  Usually, it would be when we begin reading a new section or chapter
  that is fairly self-contained and does not depend a lot on material
  we have read previously.
