  The problem with challenge-response authentication, however, is that
  it requires the server to store passwords in plaintext.  There are
  very few servers I trust enough to store my password without
  properly hashing it first.
</p>
<p>
  In practice, most systems use PLAIN authentication over a secured
  connection, such as by SSL, so that it's not susceptible to the
  man-in-the-middle problem described.
</p>
<p>
  You can also use Kerberos through GSSAPI to trust a single source
  for authentication tickets.  A Kerberos key distribution center does
  store password-equivalent data as plain-text, but it minimizes the
  number of systems that need to be protected to such a high degree.

  Matt, you make a very good point.  Yes, the server needs to store
  the passwords in plaintext in case of CRAM-MD5 authentication so
  that it can compute the expected response and match it with the
  received response.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a sample entry in the /etc/exim4/passwd file for the
  curious:
</p>
<pre><code>alice:$1$vRPkzzDi$3sqk2e4Jcgn/YEeB1JqgT1</code></pre>
<p>
  In case of PLAIN or LOGIN authentication mechanism, the above entry
  is enough to setup the user 'alice' with password 'wonderland' that
  has been used in this post.  In this example, the second field
  contains the password hashed with MD5 and a random salt.  After the
  server receives the password from the client, it would compute a
  hash from the password using the same hashing algorithm and salt
  (<code>vRPkzzDi</code> in this case) and check that the result
  matches with the hash in this file.
</p>
<p>
  For CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanism to work properly, we'll need
  an entry like this in the <code>passwd</code> file.
</p>
<pre><code>alice:$1$vRPkzzDi$3sqk2e4Jcgn/YEeB1JqgT1:wonderland</code></pre>
<p>
  Strictly speaking, the second field is not necessary.  It could have
  been empty since only the third field containing the password in
  plaintext is used to compute the expected response to the challenge
  during CRAM-MD5 authentication.
