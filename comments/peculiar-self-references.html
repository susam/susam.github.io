  This is an interesting example that the internal models of two
  programming languages can be quite different, even if they
  ostensibly support the same features.
</p>
<p>
  <code>a = a['k'] = {}</code> is also valid JavaScript syntax,
  however running it throws an exception and generally works as OP
  probably expected the statement to work.  The reason is that in JS,
  the statement is parsed as
</p>
<pre><code>a = (a['k'] = {})</code></pre>
<p>
  where <code>(a['k'] = {})</code> is executed first and also returns
  the assigned value.  Meanwhile in Python, apparently
  multi-assignment is a grammar production of its own, so the above
  would be parsed as sort of:
</p>
<pre><code>multi-assign(a, a['k']) = {}</code></pre>
<p>
  and therefore first assign to <code>a</code>, then
  to <code>a['k']</code>.

  In my opinion, it would make more sense to just treat assignments as
  expressions, as is done in C-like languages.  Maybe I'm just more
  accustomed to C-like languages, though.
</p>
<p>
  I think that one thing that makes the statement confusing is that
  the first equals sign serves a purpose completely different from the
  second equals sign, but both of them are represented by the same
  character.

  XG15, Yet another reason is all the references in LHS expressions
  are resolved before the inner expression is executed.  Thus
</p>
<pre><code>a['k'] = a = {}</code></pre>
<p>
  won't still work.

  Yeah, Python really messed up the order of multiple assignments.
  This could be fixed by deprecating arbitrary multiple assignments.
  Instead, only allow:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    any number of assignments to simple variable names (whether local,
    nonlocal, or global - I'm pretty sure these all are safe), or
  </li>
  <li>
    only one assignment to an arbitrary lvalue.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Use of "or" rather than "and" is deliberate, to fix an obscure edge
  case.  We can't even limit the restriction to "assignments involving
  a function call".  Notably, <code>self.a = a = {}</code> is not
  always the same as <code>a = self.a = {}</code>.  Proof:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.get_a = lambda: a
        a = 1
        a = self.a = 2
        a = 3
        self.a = a = 4

    def __setattr__(self, name, val):
        if name != 'get_a':
            print(self.get_a())
        self.__dict__[name] = val

if __name__ == '__main__':
    Foo()</code>

  For those who are wondering what the code in the previous comment
  does, here is its output:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>2
3</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  When <code>a = self.a = 2</code> is evaluated, the assignment
  to <code>self.a</code> triggers the <code>__setattr__</code> call
  which tells us that the <code>__init__</code> method's local
  variable <code>a</code> has already been updated to <code>2</code>.
  That's the first line of output.
</p>
<p>
  When <code>self.a = a = 4</code> is evaluated, once again the
  assignment to <code>self.a</code> triggers
  the <code>__setattr__</code> call which tells us that the value of
  local <code>a</code> is still <code>3</code>.  It has not been
  updated to <code>4</code> yet.  It gets updated to <code>4</code>
  after the assignment to <code>self.a</code> completes.
</p>
<p>
  Both lines of output demonstrate the left-to-right assignment quite
  clearly.

  This is very neat, but I would like to approach it a bit
  differently.  Python allows self-referential objects and is able to
  handle this gracefully while printing them.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = {}</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a['self'] = a</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
{'self': {...}}
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a['self']</kbd>
{'self': {...}}
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a['self']['self']</kbd>
{'self': {...}}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Python also allows chained assignments.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = b = c = d = 23.4567</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
23.4567
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>b</kbd>
23.4567
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>c</kbd>
23.4567
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>d</kbd>
23.4567</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Also, a dictionary has to be initialized before a key access.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a['k'] = {}</kbd>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'a' is not defined</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  So what the following example teaches us is how Python goes about
  allocating things in a chained assignment.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a['k'] = {}</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
{'k': {...}}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Let us look at something else with recursion which is easier for me
  to illustrate
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a[0] = [0, 1]</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
[[...], 1]</samp>
</pre>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a[1] = [0, 1]</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
[0, [...]]</samp></pre>
<p>
The operations look like following:
</p>
<pre>
<code>[0, 1] &rarr; a
a &rarr; a[0]</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If we extend the chain (<code>a = b = c = d = ...</code>) what is
  the pattern?
</p>
<p>
  I could not think of a test that would let me dissociate if what is
  happening is
</p>
<pre>
<code>a = x
b = a
c = a
d = a</code>
</pre>
or
<pre>
<code>a = x
b = a
c = b
d = c</code>
</pre>
<p>
  I might think of something tomorrow.

  Every Python object has an infinitely recursive set of attributes
  because methods are functions and functions are objects and all
  objects have methods.  It is a fun way to hit a stack overflow
  chasing them down.

  Wow.  That is surprising.  It makes sense but strikes me as the
  exact opposite of what I would expect looking at the code.  I would
  definitely have expected the binding order to be the more common
  right-to-left and for the original code to generate a name error,
  rather than the latter.

  I think you are overstating that.  It is not outright crazy or

  The thing I learned today is that multiple assignments are evaluated
  left-to-right.  I assumed it would be the other way around.
  Like <code>a[0] = a = [0]</code> would have been a lot less
  surprising.

  I am amazed at how long I have been working in Python and never

  Looking through the archives, it is a really interesting blog in

  I think it would be elegant to let assignments be expressions, and
  from that simple core rule, your parsing naturally follows.

<p>
  I find it irksome that Python makes a distinction between statements
  and expressions, instead.

  It is a fallout of the fact that assignment must be a statement, and
  cannot be an expression.  For example, this is wrong in Python,
  while it would be allowed in C-like languages:

  Heavyset, I wonder if it's because of their subtlety.  I assume you
  are referencing JavaScript, where the warts are impossible to ignore
  because you can't write an everyday program as a beginner without
  running into them.  This sort of thing from the article is just not
  something I would typically be trying to do in the normal course of
  shuffling data around.

  This is the first true "PHPism" I have seen in a "real language".
  (Is there a name for "we did not want the general thing (e.g.,
