  My first Debian install was 2.0.  I ordered the CD's (there were 2,
  as I remember) from an on-line shop that sold burned CDRs with Linux
  images.

  Yup.  I don't have the pleasure of working with Linux at my current
  job nearly as much as the last one, but Debian was (and still is) my
  preferred distro for running servers.

  Debian3, I guess your name gives it away.

<p>
  My first was Debian 4.  Ran it on a 550mhz PIII.

  Mine was a Debian 5.  Installed it on a small baremetal server for a
  client.
</p>
<p>
  The client went away, and so did I.
</p>
<p>
  Then some month ago, the client came back.  The Debian 5 is still
  online and still running (but we plan to move on a new infra with a
  Buster soon).
