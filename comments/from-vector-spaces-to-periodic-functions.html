  Very nice solution!  It is quite interesting that this does not work
  for \( e^x.  \)  I wonder if there is any general way to tell for any
  function.

  This is a nice example for why the axiom of choice is controversial.
  The proof from this blog post only works because of it.  However,
  the result seems counter-intuitive.  Let us have a look at whether
  this is only our intuition being off or whether functions with these
  properties are just "weird".
</p>
<p>
  When speaking of periodic functions the first that comes to mind is
  the \( \sin \) function.  Can something similar to such a function
  be used to construct the functions \( g \) and \( h \) from the blog
  post?  If we define them similar to \( \sin \) as periodic and
  continuous, then the answer is no.  Every periodic and continuous
  function has a maximum value.  The sum of two functions with a
  maximum value has a maximum value.  However, the identity is
  unbounded.  The sum can therefore not be the identity.
</p>
<p>
  Okay, so \( \sin \)-like functions are out.  What about
  \( \tan \)-like functions?  Take \( \tan(x) \) and \( -\tan(2x) \)
  for example.  Those are not continuous everywhere.  Well, we can
  also rule out many functions like this.  Suppose \( g \) and \( h \)
  are two periodic functions with period lengths \( a \) and \( b.  \)
  If \( \frac{a}{b} \) is rational, then the sum of \( g \) and
  \( h \) cannot be the identity function.  Suppose that \(
  \frac{a}{b} \) was rational, then \( ab \) is a common period of
  both functions, i.e., \( g(x) = g(x + ab) \) and
  \( h(x) = h(x + ab).  \)  It follows that \( (g + h)(x) = (g + h)(x +
  ab).  \)  As \( a \) and \( b \) are non-zero, it follows that \( g +
  h \) cannot be the identity function.  Functions of the form \( a
  \tan(bx) \) for rational \( b \) thus do not work.  Any two periodic
  functions where you can reason about their sum by just looking at
  what happens for individual periods are thus ruled out.
</p>
<p>
  My conclusion is that the two periodic functions from the blog post
  must look "weird".
</p>
<p>
  A common theme with axiom of choice proofs is also that they show
  the existence of something but give no hint at how this something
  actually looks like.  The proof in this blog post is a good example
  of this.  We know that the functions "exist" but have absolutely no
  clue about how they look like.  It is also an open question whether
  describing them in any other way than "the function from this proof"
  is even possible.

<p>
  Why does this need to be stated explicitly?  Why does the axiom of
  choice not enjoy the privilege of being a first-class axiom like
  other axioms?  Why do many proofs need to state the assumption of
  this axiom explicitly before using it?

  MathematicsPadawan, Because it gets you applications like this (or
  the Banach-Tarski paradox), which make you wonder how much it
  deserves its place.  To some extent this is more due to Tertium Non
  Datur than to the axiom of choice, but my impression is ZF doesn't
  know enough about infinite sets to get to the really
  counter-intuitive stuff.

  MathematicsPadawan, Proofs (at least when they are written "the
  usual" way) are human-to-human communication, not human-to-machine
  encoding.  A proof depending on the axiom of choice is a more
  interesting fact than it depending on, say, the axiom schema of
  specification, so it makes sense that the author might want to say
  "hey, pay attention to that".

  GenerationP,
</p>
<p>
  There are counter-intuitive results in ZF without choice too:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Collection of non-empty sets with empty cartesian product.
  </li>
  <li>
    Infinite set without a countable infinite subset.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a pair of sets such that neither is equinumerous with a
    subset of the other.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  More or less, our intuition about seemingly obvious ideas is
  completely thrown off without choice.  Banach-Tarski at least has
  the property that it probably doesn't directly apply to the real
  world (if you can split an object into probably physically
  impossible sets and then rejoin them correctly then you can double
  the volume of the physical object) and so doesn't really violate our
  intuition &mdash; the premise doesn't apply in the real world, so no
  conclusion really matters.  It's like claiming that every element of
  the empty set is a leprechaun with a pot of gold &mdash; it's true,
  but it doesn't matter in any meaningful sense.

  Hansvm, If I understand correctly, your examples
  are <em>undecidable</em> rather than true in ZF.  That's why we can
  add the axiom of choice without getting contradictions.

  I seem to be missing something.  I'm reading this as looking for
  functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \) to \(
  \mathbb{R}, \) such that \( f(x) + g(x) = 1 \) and \( f(x + p) =
  f(x).  \)  If I were reading that correctly, then for any periodic \(
  f(x), \) \( g(x) = 1 - f(x) \) would do, meaning any old periodic
  function would do.  What am I missing?
</p>
<p>
  Am I also reading it right that the author is saying the axiom of
  choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector space has a
  finite basis?  I don't get how that allows infinite dimensional
  vector spaces.  If not, and it's just that every vector space has a
  basis that maybe infinite, then what's the justification of the
  Hamel basis being finite?
</p>
<p>
  I feel like I'm missing a lot between the lines here.

  Im3w1l, Well, sure.  Without choice there exist models of ZF where
  those properties hold.  Adding choice precludes those models, i.e.,
  it restricts our axioms in a way which prevents certain kinds of
  unexpected results.

  MathematicsPadawan, It is partly historical notoriety.  It allows
  one to prove certain statements that seem counter-intuitive.  So
  proofs that employ it can often be viewed with some skepticism.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, this axiom is <em>independent</em> of the other axioms in
  ZFC.  It is in fact possible to have entirely self-consistent
  "worlds" of mathematics, ones where the axiom of choice is true, and
  ones where it is false.
</p>
<p>
  More details and examples of alternate axioms are in the Wikipedia
  article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom
  of choice</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If it seems weird that mathematics can give you contradictory
  results, remember that the difference only shows up when you deal
  with some form of infinity (e.g., when performing an operation on an
  infinitely large set).  For any usage of mathematics in the real
  world, the truth or falsity of this axiom won't give you
  contradictory results.

<p>
  6gvONxR4sf7o, Not quite.  The axiom of choice is equivalent to
  saying every vector space has a Hamel basis, which is to say every
  element can be represented as a finite combination of elements of
  the Hamel basis.  It doesn't imply that the Hamel basis is finite
  itself.
