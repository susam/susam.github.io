  K&amp;R is easily one of the best CS/programming books.  Short,
  concise and to the point.
</p>
<p>
  Another way to learn pointers is via assembly.  Either learn
  assembly or just look at the disassembled code.  Look under the hood
  and it'll become clearer.
</p>
<p>
  Of course the best way is to write your own C compiler but that may
  be overkill for most.

  Rather more surprising, at first sight, is the fact that a reference
  to <code>a[i]</code> can also be written as <code>*(a+i)</code>.

<p>
  I did not find that all that surprising, but the first time I saw
  that <code>a[i]</code> can also be written as <code>i[a]</code>, I
  was very irritated.

  I don't know.  I read the pointers chapter at least 3 times, and I
  still get confused when I see pointer stuff in real code.  The other
  day, I read the
  <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">famous regex
  post by Russ Cox</a>, and it took me a couple of hours to understand
  the pointer parts of the code even though the algorithm behind it
  was relatively simple.  I guess pointers are just one of those
  things that for some people make a lot of sense, whereas others
  struggle with.
