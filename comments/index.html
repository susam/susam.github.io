  Thanks for the interesting articles and for making them available

<h2><a href="https://github.com/dotnetcarpenter">Jon</a> commented on <a href="../million-times-million.html"><em>Million Times Million</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  I'm from Denmark were we use the long scale.  I didn't know a long
  scale form existed in English!  It happens quite often that a
  billion, in English, gets translated to a billion in Danish, which
  is off by \( 999 \times 10^9, \) and of course, should have been a
  milliard.  ;-)

<h2>RaÃºl Ward commented on <a href="../million-times-million.html"><em>Million Times Million</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  In Spanish speaking countries, a billion is a million millions.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is that sometimes, when translating news or articles
  from English, they do it literally, so an English billion (one
  thousand millions) is put in Spanish as a "billÃ³n" (a million
  millions).  That is a source of mistaken amounts.

<h2>Cyril commented on <a href="../million-times-million.html"><em>Million Times Million</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  In French, we use the long scale almost as is.  We
  have <em>milliard</em>, <em>trilliard</em>, etc.
</p>
<p>
  We always have to convert the English's billion to French's
  milliard, and so on.  Yet, we haven't learned the rule for the
  "scale", since there's none for the long scale's <em>-iard</em>
  numbers.  Each multiple-of-3 power of 10 has a name and that's it.

<h2>Jas commented on <a href="../from-finite-integral-domains-to-finite-fields.html"><em>From Finite Integral Domains to Finite Fields</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  This was a great read!  The explanation of why every finite integral
  domain is a field was clear and insightful.  It's fascinating how
  the absence of zero divisors and the finiteness of the set combine
  to ensure that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.
  Thanks for breaking it down so well.

  And I really thought appending strings together and

  I didn't even know you could write integers with Python.  I'll start

  Thanks for posting this.  It sometimes feels like every web
  developer on the planet is all-in on dark themes, so it's great to
  see someone doing this kind of analysis.  For the record, I've yet
  to see a dark theme that I can view for more than about 60 seconds
  before my vision becomes blurry (see
  <a href="https://boot13.com/firefox/dark-mode-rant/">boot13.com/firefox/dark-mode-rant/</a>).
  I encourage developers to provide light theme options, but I also
  use tools like Tranquility when that's not available.

  Thank you, AquariusDue, for your kind words.  Unfortunately, I've
  not had the time to look into the <code>which-key</code>
  contribution yet.  I definitely plan to look into it, but it may
  take some time.  I've been juggling other responsibilities lately,
  so I'm currently taking a break from open-source maintenance
  activities.  When I can spare the time again, I will focus on
  reviewing the open PRs PRs for <code>devil-mode</code>.

<h2>AquariusDue commented on <a href="../indieweb-does-not-need-to-take-off.html"><em>The IndieWeb Doesn't Need to "Take Off"</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  I totally resonate with the sentiment.  Nowadays it seems that more
  people than before are afraid to get into something new for the joy
  of it unless there's already a broad appeal.  Personally I attribute
  it to a weird kind of "fear of missing out" in which the individual
  prefers to not commit because of opportunity cost.  What if
  something cooler comes along and what I'm already invested in
  doesn't catch on?  Better do nothing then.
</p>
<p>
  All this basically boils down to mixing external validation with inner joy, I guess?
</p>
<p>
  Off-topic: Thank you for
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/devil">Devil</a>

  great!  Emfy really demystified Emacs config the second time I got

  Hello, I am a casual user of MathB.in.  I must have been using it
  for over 5 years, and it's been a very useful tool.  It's basically
  the place where I developed my ability to write in LaTeX.  So I
  appreciate you maintaining it up to now, and I understand your
  reasons for stopping.  Best wishes!

  I'm sorry to hear that.  The independent web is gradually declining,

  original vision and spirit of the independent web are fading away
  due to many reasons, which is disheartening.  Thank you for all your

  It feels a bit sentimental to see it shutting down, but it was a
  great help for me to easily get help from friends when I was doing
  my bachelor degree in engineering.  But the conclusion for it
  shutting down is understandable.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/rswgnu">Robert (rsw)</a> commented on <a href="../emacs-info-expressions.html"><em>Emacs Info Expressions</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Just load the Hyperbole package and remove the space between the
  manual and node name.
</p>
<p>
  Then in any Emacs buffer you can add <code>"(manual)node"</code> in
  double quotes, press <code>M-RET</code> with point on that string
  and display the associated node.  This works for Info index entries
  as well.  Keep it simple.

  Thank you, Karthink, Joost and Mekeor for the comments!  Indeed,

  Do you know about the zero-prefix for <code>c</code> (or
  equally <code>w</code>) in <code>Info-mode</code>?  It puts the <code>info</code>
  <code>s-expression</code> into the kill ring, e.g., personally I

<h2>Joost commented on <a href="../emacs-info-expressions.html"><em>Emacs Info Expressions</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  There's an easier way: In an info buffer, type <code>M-0 c</code>
  instead of just <code>c</code>, and Emacs will put the info node's
  name inside a call to <code>info</code> (i.e., you get <code>(info
  "(dir) Top")</code> in the kill ring.)

  You can use a prefix arg of 0 in the info node &mdash; <code>C-0
  c</code> or <code>C-u 0 c</code> &mdash; to copy the full info

<p>
  No; i decrements to <code>INT_MIN</code>
  after <code>|INT_MIN|</code> iterations.  For example,
  if <code>i</code> were a signed 1-bit integer,
  making <code>INT_MIN</code> equal to <code>-1</code>,

  executing <code>--i</code> after the first iteration.

<p>
  Of course, you're correct that <code>|INT_MIN| + 1</code> dots are

  Thank you, Ikiatl and Presh, for your comments.  The formula for \(

  c \) obtained from the formula \( c = 4x - 1 \) in the examples, the
  formula itself was written incorrectly as \( c = 4x - 3.  \)  I have

<p>
  Wonderful post!  I am preparing a video on Langford pairings and
  your proof was incredibly helpful and written in great detail.  Many
  articles come to the necessary condition and just assume sufficiency
  which is wrong.  Yours is the only article that proves both the
  necessity and the sufficiency of the condition.  The construction of
  the sequence in your post is wonderful.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, I believe there is a small typo in the formula for
  \( c.  \)  It should be \( c = 4x - 1.  \)

<p>
  This is a great explanation, especially the part describing how
  control codes are mapped to their corresponding letters.  I always
  felt there was probably some logic to it, but the idea never fully
  materialized into something I thought to investigate.  Learning
  about how to disable XON/OFF is more like a bonus.

  Thank you, HÃ©ctor, for your comment!  I updated the example program
  in this post as follows to test the compression feature:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(defun main ()
  (format t "hello, world~%"))
(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "hello" :executable t :compression t :toplevel #'main)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Indeed this created an executable that was only 8.1 MB in size
  whereas without compression the executable size is 35 MB.

  You can greatly reduce the executable size when compiling with SBCL
  by adding
</p>
<pre><code>:compression t</code></pre>
<p>
  to the following:
</p>
<pre>
<code>(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "hello" :executable t :toplevel #'main)</code>

<h2>KDK commented on <a href="../from-xon-xoff-to-forward-incremental-search.html"><em>From XON/XOFF to Forward Incremental Search</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  This was a very interesting read!  I have personally solved this by
  using fuzzy finder, which gives a menu/search box with a selection
  instead of the simplistic string matching
  of <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a heavy terminal user, I would recommend looking into
  <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fzf">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fzf</a>.
  I see the built-in search being especially useful on remote/shared
  machines, where you do not necessarily want to install stuff.
</p>
<p>
  The XON/XOFF feature actually seems quite useful for terminals
  without scrollback.  Or for when you don't have a mouse.  Hopefully
  I'll remember it.  Thank you very much for your article!

<p>
  The nostalgia is well-placed!
</p>
<p>
  I think old technologies never really die out, but rather shift from
  popular use to niche use, and often get more interesting during the
  transition.  The pain points of the new and old systems become
  directly comparable and opting in to the old (or parts of it)
  becomes deliberate.  This site, for example, is handcrafted on
  purpose, rather than out of necessity (as it would have been on
  early GeoCities), but still has a GitHub.io mirror - the old and the
  new live congenially together.
</p>
<p>
  And I love it.  Thanks for all the joy.

<h2>Googlryas commented on <a href="../winpopup.html"><em>WinPopup</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Vyrotek,
</p>
<p>
  Similar story.  I was in the 10th grade, and we had a teacher who,
  in study hall, would make us all watch a projector of her monitor
  just reading awful PowerPoint slides about whatever topic she was
  interested in.  I wanted to do my homework in that period since I
  never did homework at home, but she wouldn't allow it.  Other people
  wanted to quietly socialize but could not.  Everyone hated it.
</p>
<p>
  So on one of the computers in the back of the room, I used Windows
  Task Scheduler to do something akin to <code>net send
  room-6a-teacher COMPUTER MUST BE REBOOTED IMMEDIATELY</code> every 5
  minutes for the duration of the class.  The teacher was not very
  tech savvy.  She once claimed to have deleted regedit, because it
  looked like a Rubik's Cube and she did not want games on her
  computer.  She never ended up figuring out why her computer messed
  up during our class but it let us have our study hall back as our
  own.
</p>
<p>
  In the 12th grade I told my computer networking teacher that story
  and he said he knew exactly what was happening but not who did or
  why they did, so he did not want to stick his nose in to a study
  hall.  He said, "I should have figured it was you".  I took it as a
  compliment of the highest order.

<h2><a href="https://susam.net/">Susam Pal</a> commented on <a href="../from-xon-xoff-to-forward-incremental-search.html"><em>From XON/XOFF to Forward Incremental Search</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Thank you, Peter, for your comments.  It took a few changes to get
  your Bash script to work properly in my shell.  Since I do not
  have <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> set in my shell, the evaluation of
  the following prompt command
</p>
<pre><code>PROMPT_COMMAND="$PROMPT_COMMAND; : _IXONOFF"</code></pre>
<p>
  was causing this error:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>bash: PROMPT_COMMAND: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `;'
bash: PROMPT_COMMAND: line 0: `; : _IXONOFF'</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how I modified your script to check
  if <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> is set before expanding it.  If it is
  not set we use the null command <code>:</code> before the semicolon
  separator.
</p>
<pre>
<code>unset _IXON
PROMPT_COMMAND="${PROMPT_COMMAND:-:}; : _IXONOFF"
function _TRAP_DEBUG {
   if [ "$BASH_COMMAND" = ": _IXONOFF" ]; then
      stty -ixon
      _IXON=1
   elif [ "$_IXON" = "1" ]; then
      stty ixon
      unset _IXON
   fi
}
trap _TRAP_DEBUG DEBUG</code>
</pre>
<p>
  To test this, we can add the above script to <code>~/.bashrc</code>,
  then run something like <code>ping localhost</code> and confirm
  that <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> pauses the output, whereas in the
  shell <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> performs forward incremental
  search.

<p>
  With respect to the cantrip, the below line
  in <code>~/.inputrc</code> might be preferable, as it remaps
  (forward) i-search to <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>^</kbd> for all programs
  using GNU-readline.
</p>
<pre><code>"\C-^": forward-search-history</code></pre>
<p>
  And if you edit <code>~/.inputrc</code>, consider adding a mapping
  for <code>kill-region</code>, in my case using an en-US keymap, its
  <kbd>esc</kbd> <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>@</kbd>, and permits to
  move/copy/erase character regions together

  As an alternative, use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> for
  "forward-inc-search"; it's easier to remember (mnemonic) and means
  you can still use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd>

  Can you <em>please</em> write a tutorial on how you made this
  website from beginning to end?  I know the code is available but a
  tutorial with explanations would be useful.  Students can learn from
  it.  Your website is one of the best coded websites I have ever come

  Also I've recently started learning Common Lisp.  It's really nice

<p>
  Sorry for the double posts!
</p>
<p>
  I found the return time on the form was not as fast as I expected.
  I have a suspicion your duplicates may be partially due to the UI of
  the form.  True: it shows a message saying "comment was submitted
  successfully", but it also leaves the exact same form up, with all
  the content.  This is both unusual, in my experience, and I think a
  bit confusing.  Why would all content still be available and live
  for editing if the form was really submitted?
</p>
<p>
  I think people probably hit the "Submit Comment" button multiple
  times because they are used to the comment content either
  disappearing after it has been sent, or at least changing
  appearance, so that it is not longer an input form, but now displays
  the un-editable content (thus reflecting that the content has been
  submitted).
</p>
<p>
  I suspect that if you fix this "UI bug", then you'll no longer see
  those duplicates.

  Seems to be an interesting, disappointing, and illustrative case of
  "worse is better".  We get so conditioned to things working
  sub-optimally, we feel uncomfortable in improved circumstance.

  You should make it so that if the same client submits the same
  comment twice in a short period of time with the same message, it
  will disregard it.  Or you can say "yes, it was actually submitted
  the first time, don't worry," on multiple attempts?

  Update, it is extremely fast.  However, it doesn't clear input which
  is a bit of a confusing UX when submitted successfully.

  Another thing.  When I clicked submit again, the comment didn't
  disappear from the comment box.  Text usually disappears when you
  click submit, so that is also probably confusing people.

  Wow, that is fast.  I don't think it is just the JavaScript bloated
  web that is confusing people.  It is also faster than the animations
  in desktop applications.  It makes me wonder, why do OS deliberately
  add so much latency with their animations?

  Oh my.  Adding to my last comment: I wasn't expecting to see the
  content of my comment still populated in the form after submitting!
  Whether people are aware of it or not, they may be confused by this.
  Despite the success message (people don't read), this may feel more
  like the experience of getting validation errors before a submission
  request goes through.  Even just making the fields readonly on
  success would probably help with the confusion.

<p>
  Ahh I see the problem now.  You also have an interaction design
  issue that makes submitting twice too easy, you leave the form
  content filled.
</p>
<p>
  In a traditional POST form scenario you're moving the user to a new
  page that captures the data and says something like "Comment
  submitted successfully", perhaps with the comment displayed as text.
  In a <em>bloated javascript website</em> it's typical to hide the
  form after submission to remove the temptation.  (Don't forget
  oldbies with a propensity to double-click a submit button!)

  You could circumvent this issue by replying with something unique to
  the user such as IP address.  For example, "Comment accepted from
  IP:xxx.xxx.xxx".

<h2><a href="https://eyelidlessness.github.io">eyelidlessness</a> commented on <a href="../comfort-of-bloated-web.html"><em>Comfort of Bloated Web</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  This is a UX phenomenon that comes up from time to time, and
  sometimes adding an artificial delay does in fact feels better for
  at least some portion of users.  Another solution that might help is
  a *very* small bit of JS which receives a 204 response (browsers
  won't navigate on 204), then clears the form/shows success in situ.
  Sure, it's a *little more* dynamic, and I'm sensitive to adding JS
  unnecessarily (my site currently has none after build), but it would
  be a lot less likely to feel like a false positive.  You could even
  add an artificial delay to *displaying* that, as an A/B test just to
  see if it yields fewer duplicates.
</p>
<p>
  Both those suggestions are partly sincere and partly in jest.  I
  doubt either of them line up with your goals, mostly posting them in
  case they might benefit other readers.  But a fully sincere
  suggestion which I think might be more suitable: display the
  received comment or some truncated portion of it as pending in the
  success response.  It's unlikely to add noticeable delay or bloat,
  but it would confirm that the contents of the comment were actually
  received.  This isn't a substantial difference in the perceived
  performance, but people have become accustomed to seeing that their
  action had an *effect* (specifically a side-effect).
</p>
<p>
  Feel free, of course, to totally ignore any and all of this advice.
  Thanks for having a site that's fast and lightweight!

  Ironically, I was just having a similar conversation with a friend

  Additionally, I'd suggest modifying the form so that the submit
  button goes away after successful submission, because it's <em>so

  Maybe add a note to the success message, along the lines of "Yes,
  the comment was actually received by the server.  Feels too fast to
  be true?  You may have become used to poorly engineered websites
  being <em>really slow</em>."  With the last sentence being a link to

  I think you could improve the UX by putting the success message on
  top and pushing the content down.  Also disable the submit button to
  avoid double submission.

  I love snippets like this because they're so useful for teaching.
  Suits the "Socratic/inductive" method of saying "Oh, if only we had
  a tool that does this kind of route tracing ...  Oh wait a minute
  ...  Hmm what's traceroute do?"

<p>
  They also demonstrate the Unix philosophy that more complex tools
  can be built from smaller ones.

<p>
  Thanks for making and sharing this!  It's awesome to see a dream
  fulfilled!
</p>
<p>
  I have a lot of fun making little JavaScript games like this and
  recently made a way to create sprites
  using <a href="https://memalign.github.io/p/pceimage.html">ASCII</a>
  inline with the code.  I call these "pixel-character encoded images"
  aka PCEImages.  I also made
  an <a href="https://memalign.github.io/m/pceimage/index.html">editor
  web page</a> to help make this ASCII art.
</p>
<p>
  I noticed your sprites are drawn as rectangles in the canvas.
  PCEImage could hopefully drop in pretty easily if you want to try it
  out!

<h2>Fillon commented on <a href="../wordle-with-grep.html"><em>Wordle With Grep</em></a>:</h2>

  Susam,
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for the explanation.  I did not notice earlier that the
  result has an extra 'e' in a gray tile.  You are right.  Since the
  extra 'e' has been evaluated and marked gray, it cannot occur as a
  repeated letter.

<h2><a href="https://susam.net/">Susam Pal</a> commented on <a href="../wordle-with-grep.html"><em>Wordle With Grep</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Fillon,
</p>
<p>
  I am aware that there can be repeated letters.  In
  fact, <a href="../wordle-with-grep.html#wordle-219">Wordle #219</a>
  ("knoll") does indeed have repeated letters.  However, in Wordle
  #217 we can be sure that there is no repeated letter 'e'.
</p>
<p>
  In <a href="../wordle-with-grep.html#wordle-217">Wordle #217</a>,
  after we enter the word "beige" as the second guess, the result has
  the letter 'e' in a green tile and another occurrence of the letter
  'e' in a gray tile.  The gray tile containing 'e' confirms that
  there is no repeated letter 'e'.  Here is how the second result
  looks:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold; color: #ddd">
  <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">B</span>
  <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
  <span style="background: #b93; padding: 0.5em">I</span>
  <span style="background: #333; padding: 0.5em">G</span>
  <span style="background: #585; padding: 0.5em">E</span>
</p>
<p>
  If there were no occurrence of 'e' in an unsolved tile in the result
  above or if there were another 'e' in a yellow tile, then a repeated
  'e' could have been present.  But in the result above, we have
  another 'e' in a gray tile.  This gray tile guarantees that the
  letter 'e' does not repeat in the solution.

<p>
  Nice!  I like the systematic approach.
</p>
<p>
  The problem occurs if there are many words that differ from the
  target word by only one letter, e.g., bears, fears, gears, pears,
  tears, wears, years - in this case, it would be most useful to
  create a word using as many of those first letters as possible - for
  example, "befit" with b,f,t - so that only one guess is used up to
  find what the first letter is.

  for a version of lunar lander on a TRS-80 on the sale floor of my
  local Radio Shack.

  Later I learned to write my own kits.  And sometime after that, I
  got others to pay me for the pleasure - Winning!

  I use Matrix and bridge in IRC, and third-party platforms whenever
  necessary.  So much less cognitive load having it all in one place.

<p>
  Everyone should write an IRC client as an exercise in network
  programming due to its simplicity.  The other IM protocol for which
  I've written a client is early MSNP, which is also text-based and
  not immensely more complicated than IRC.  IMHO all the newer
  web-based stuff is a horrible mess of abstraction bloat.  TCP, and
  TLS if you want encryption, should be a sufficient base to build
  upon.

<h2><a href="https://turtlespaces.org">Melody Ayres-Griffiths</a> commented on <a href="../fd-100.html"><em>FD 100</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Great article!  :) I spend my days
  developing <a href="https://turtlespaces.org/">turtleSpaces</a>, a
  modern 3D environment for coding in Logo, based on the Apple Logo II
  implementation (and greatly expanded upon).  Like the original Logos
  it has a REPL and you can just type <code>FD 100</code> and the
  turtle will happily move as expected.
</p>
<p>
  It's written in Go, and as such has builds for macOS, Linux and
  Windows, as well as a WebAssembly build which runs inside of a
  Javascript-based IDE.  We still have a ways to go to reach our goal
  of a Logo-based multi-player 3D game engine (like Roblox) but you
  can do a great deal with it as it stands now, including creating STL
  files for 3D printing and making simple games and animations.

<h2>Sundar commented on <a href="../fd-100.html"><em>FD 100</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  It seems a pretty common thing to have a pleasant nostalgic memory
  of Logo as a fun introduction to programming.  My experience with it
  was pretty different.  I found it pretty pointless and boring at the
  time.  It didn't have any pull on me the way C later did.
</p>
<p>
  Ironically, a big part of what made C fun for me were the Borland
  conio (console I/O) and graphics libraries.  Those were fun only
  because I could respond to user interactions and make simple games
  and other playful things.  Looking back on it, that was probably the
  missing ingredient with Logo for me.  We were never taught any ways
  of user input.  They were just static programs that did one thing
  and that feels fundamentally different.

  Yeti,

<p>
  You don't understand what happened at Xerox PARC or what their "GUI"
  was.  Smalltalk wasn't a language.  It wasn't a GUI.  It was an
  <em>environment</em>.  Its whole point was that it didn't hide
  anything!  It was a completely different paradigm to how computers
  and their programs are architected today.  A Smalltalk system was
  always meant to be so simple that one could understand, and change,
  everything about it.

  I've never really played around with IRC, but I've definitely had
  the experience the author talks about with Matrix.  The server (like
  mentioned about IRC) is complicated, but interfacing with it as a
  user or a bot is mostly a few REST endpoints.  I've started using
  Matrix as my go-to interface for new projects.  You get I/O for

  We had a Logo turtle at school in the late 80s I guess.  I can't

<h2>Andrew McWatters commented on <a href="../simplicity-of-irc.html"><em>Simplicity of IRC</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  I never used IRC growing up, to my knowledge, though I'm sure I used
  it by proxy in software that used it under the hood.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, I grew up with AOL Instant Messenger, and then MSN
  Messenger which later became Windows Live Messenger, then Skype,
  Xfire, Pidgin and Trillian as clients, then back to Skype again, and
  now Discord, which is where I still reside most of the time today.
</p>
<p>
  When I thought about existing chat protocols I wanted to use in game
  engines and websites that would allow one to connect through
  existing clients without having to join the game or navigate to the
  website in question directly, I thought about IRC.
</p>
<p>
  But it seems like people use Matrix now, and it just hasn't caught
  on to my circle of friends.  If I'm not mistaken, it almost seems
  like FOSS Discord.
</p>
<p>
  I was recently introduced to it by a member of a community of very
  friendly Quake Mappers.  I wonder if there is primarily first a
  cultural barrier to these technologies and not a technical one.  As
  usually I find more technical people on IRC than on Discord.

  I agree 100% with the author -- logo as a child is what started me
  on programming.  My first programming experience was in ~1981 or so
  when my elementary school teacher brought an Apple II into our
  classroom.  She was getting her MS in education, and it was on-loan
  from her college.  It was loaded with Apple Logo, and you had to pry
  me away from it with a crowbar.  That was one of the first times I
  stayed after school willingly.  I hounded my parents mercilessly
  until they finally bought an Apple II clone.
</p>
<p>
  I eventually learned BASIC, and learned debugging and "hacking" by
  fixing the games that I typed in (incorrectly) from magazines and
  modifying them to do different things.

  I recently tried Discord to find programming communities but I just
  don't get it.  When you join a server you are automatically
  subscribed to all the channels.  And apparently you can't leave

  As an aside, can I just say how refreshing this website is?  It's
  100% content, just text.  Now view the HTML source, and be amazed.
  I daresay the author actually wrote the HTML by hand.  I suppose it
  could be a very conservative and conscientious site generator that
  even respects line length, but I'd be surprised.  Short CSS file for
  minimal style tweaks, and readable markup.  Fitting that the article

  I'd say it's in the same general box as the simplicity of 8-bit
  computers booting into Basic interpreter, and the simplicity of
  Legos.
</p>
<p>
  It's wonderful when you can have your toys in a sandbox where you
  use and develop them mostly for fun, and for scratching your own
  itch, away from well-moneyed interests.  No need to carefully
  identify participants.  No need to encrypt, or otherwise complicate
  the implementation.  No need to efficiently serve millions of users.
  No need to add bling to attract more of those who barely cares.
  (The latter is not the case with Legos lately, though.)
</p>
<p>
  This is why I think that a lot of innovation starts in the fringe,
  and looks like mostly useless toys, until one of these toys proves
  very useful for &quot;real world&quot; needs.

  In the beginning was the command line.  Then the work of the bright
  people of Xerox PARC was used to hide from users the reality that
  lied underneath their beloved GUI: computers are just passing around
  strings of text.  Now we yearn for a time when we are just one

<h2><a href="https://johannes.truschnigg.info/">Johannes Truschnigg</a> commented on <a href="../simplicity-of-irc.html"><em>Simplicity of IRC</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  A number of moons ago, I switched from a company that used IRC for
  its internal, real-time, ephemeral communication needs to an
  enterprise shop that used Microsoft Teams to do that (and of course
  other communication stuff, as the boundaries for what was better
  kept in Sharepoint, Confluence, Email/Exchange, the legacy Wiki,
  and/or Teams were never quite clear :)) there.
</p>
<p>
  In the old shop, we eventually had all kinds of important subsystems
  hooked up to our internal IRC server: Monitoring and alerting.
  Source control and Wiki activity.  The deployment pipeline.  Ticket
  activity reports.  All these services were pretty much effortlessly
  set up to provide useful, real-time status information broadcast to
  topic-specific channels users could idle in.  Everyone could stay
  informed on topics of their interest, in real time, with no barrier
  to entry.  It was really good, and the implementation completed in a
  few hours total, for all use-cases, due to IRC's incredible
  simplicity.
</p>
<p>
  Due to the benefits I had reaped from that setup before, I tried to
  implement parts of it on/for the MS Teams platform at the then-new
  job.  Getting the Teams Python SDK to implement a bot-like entity
  running alone proved to be a days-long ordeal, and whatever followed
  wasn't much more pleasant.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, we let someone set up two
  email-to-teams-channel-forwards which kinda worked, but suffered
  from obnoxious, multi-minute relay delays.
</p>
<p>
  As a consequence of the tedious bringup and the latency shortcoming,
  the "effortless notification" initiative never really got traction.
</p>
<p>
  Not only because of this particular experience I am a firm believer
  that software/system simplicity is a virtue that can neither be
  overstated in importance, nor substituted by anything else.

  It's a real shame how difficult programming is.  I don't mean that
  it is difficult to write difficult things, but that it is difficult
  to write simple things.  Once upon a time, one could download Visual
  Studio, click about to make a new project in, for example, Visual
  Basic, draw a GUI in the GUI editor, and click the run button.  One
  could then start adding simple functionality (e.g., working through
  a book).  Or even longer ago when a computer might dump you
  practically straight into BASIC when you turned it on or you might
  get access to a mainframe/minicomputer with programming tools
  already set up.  Nowadays, an "easy" introduction could involve the
  horrific process of installing and setting up Python on Windows
  (where it is hard to do things other than input/output text) or
  editing some HTML/JavaScript files where there are more easily
  possible interactive things but lots of things are difficult like
  <em>just drawing things</em> or anything that requires a server
  side.
</p>
<p>
  If you, like me, were wondering what Libera Chat is, it's the moral
  successor of Freenode with Freenode now being a shell of its former
  self.

  Nickname management is complicated.  I like to use the same nickname
  from multiple IRC clients running on multiple systems.  It used to
  work earlier but not any more.  Recovering a nickname after you've

  This is great!  I just recently started using Vlime and had been

  your <kbd>\</kbd><kbd>r</kbd><kbd>r</kbd> hotkey has just saved me
  lots of annoyance!

  Same with the interactive debugging, I didn't know you could inspect

  This is the first true "PHPism" I have seen in a "real language".

  Heavyset, I wonder if it's because of their subtlety.  I assume you
  are referencing JavaScript, where the warts are impossible to ignore
  because you can't write an everyday program as a beginner without
  running into them.  This sort of thing from the article is just not
  something I would typically be trying to do in the normal course of

  Some languages wear the things that make you go WTF on their

<h2>Oliver commented on <a href="../peculiar-self-references.html"><em>Peculiar Self-References</em></a>:</h2>

  It is a fallout of the fact that assignment must be a statement, and
  cannot be an expression.  For example, this is wrong in Python,
  while it would be allowed in C-like languages:
</p>
<pre><code>print(a = 5)</code></pre>

  I think it would be elegant to let assignments be expressions, and
  from that simple core rule, your parsing naturally follows.
</p>
<p>
  I find it irksome that Python makes a distinction between statements

  The thing I learned today is that multiple assignments are evaluated
  left-to-right.  I assumed it would be the other way around.
  Like <code>a[0] = a = [0]</code> would have been a lot less
  surprising.

  Wow.  That is surprising.  It makes sense but strikes me as the
  exact opposite of what I would expect looking at the code.  I would
  definitely have expected the binding order to be the more common
  right-to-left and for the original code to generate a name error,
  rather than the latter.

  Every Python object has an infinitely recursive set of attributes
  because methods are functions and functions are objects and all
  objects have methods.  It is a fun way to hit a stack overflow
  chasing them down.

<p>
  This is very neat, but I would like to approach it a bit
  differently.  Python allows self-referential objects and is able to
  handle this gracefully while printing them.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = {}</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a['self'] = a</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
{'self': {...}}
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a['self']</kbd>
{'self': {...}}
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a['self']['self']</kbd>
{'self': {...}}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Python also allows chained assignments.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = b = c = d = 23.4567</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
23.4567
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>b</kbd>
23.4567
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>c</kbd>
23.4567
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>d</kbd>
23.4567</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Also, a dictionary has to be initialized before a key access.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a['k'] = {}</kbd>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'a' is not defined</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  So what the following example teaches us is how Python goes about
  allocating things in a chained assignment.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a['k'] = {}</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
{'k': {...}}</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Let us look at something else with recursion which is easier for me
  to illustrate
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a[0] = [0, 1]</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
[[...], 1]</samp>
</pre>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a = a[1] = [0, 1]</kbd>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>a</kbd>
[0, [...]]</samp></pre>
<p>
The operations look like following:
</p>
<pre>
<code>[0, 1] &rarr; a
a &rarr; a[0]</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If we extend the chain (<code>a = b = c = d = ...</code>) what is
  the pattern?
</p>
<p>
  I could not think of a test that would let me dissociate if what is
  happening is
</p>
<pre>
<code>a = x
b = a
c = a
d = a</code>
</pre>
or
<pre>
<code>a = x
b = a
c = b
d = c</code>
</pre>
<p>
  I might think of something tomorrow.

<h2><a href="https://susam.net/">Susam Pal</a> commented on <a href="../peculiar-self-references.html"><em>Peculiar Self-References</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  For those who are wondering what the code in the previous comment
  does, here is its output:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>2
3</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  When <code>a = self.a = 2</code> is evaluated, the assignment
  to <code>self.a</code> triggers the <code>__setattr__</code> call
  which tells us that the <code>__init__</code> method's local
  variable <code>a</code> has already been updated to <code>2</code>.
  That's the first line of output.
</p>
<p>
  When <code>self.a = a = 4</code> is evaluated, once again the
  assignment to <code>self.a</code> triggers
  the <code>__setattr__</code> call which tells us that the value of
  local <code>a</code> is still <code>3</code>.  It has not been
  updated to <code>4</code> yet.  It gets updated to <code>4</code>
  after the assignment to <code>self.a</code> completes.
</p>
<p>
  Both lines of output demonstrate the left-to-right assignment quite
  clearly.

<h2>o11c commented on <a href="../peculiar-self-references.html"><em>Peculiar Self-References</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Yeah, Python really messed up the order of multiple assignments.
  This could be fixed by deprecating arbitrary multiple assignments.
  Instead, only allow:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    any number of assignments to simple variable names (whether local,
    nonlocal, or global - I'm pretty sure these all are safe), or
  </li>
  <li>
    only one assignment to an arbitrary lvalue.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Use of "or" rather than "and" is deliberate, to fix an obscure edge
  case.  We can't even limit the restriction to "assignments involving
  a function call".  Notably, <code>self.a = a = {}</code> is not
  always the same as <code>a = self.a = {}</code>.  Proof:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.get_a = lambda: a
        a = 1
        a = self.a = 2
        a = 3
        self.a = a = 4

    def __setattr__(self, name, val):
        if name != 'get_a':
            print(self.get_a())
        self.__dict__[name] = val

if __name__ == '__main__':
    Foo()</code>

<h2>JWMH commented on <a href="../peculiar-self-references.html"><em>Peculiar Self-References</em></a>:</h2>

  In my opinion, it would make more sense to just treat assignments as
  expressions, as is done in C-like languages.  Maybe I'm just more
  accustomed to C-like languages, though.
</p>
<p>
  I think that one thing that makes the statement confusing is that
  the first equals sign serves a purpose completely different from the
  second equals sign, but both of them are represented by the same
  character.

<h2>XG15 commented on <a href="../peculiar-self-references.html"><em>Peculiar Self-References</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  This is an interesting example that the internal models of two
  programming languages can be quite different, even if they
  ostensibly support the same features.
</p>
<p>
  <code>a = a['k'] = {}</code> is also valid JavaScript syntax,
  however running it throws an exception and generally works as OP
  probably expected the statement to work.  The reason is that in JS,
  the statement is parsed as
</p>
<pre><code>a = (a['k'] = {})</code></pre>
<p>
  where <code>(a['k'] = {})</code> is executed first and also returns
  the assigned value.  Meanwhile in Python, apparently
  multi-assignment is a grammar production of its own, so the above
  would be parsed as sort of:
</p>
<pre><code>multi-assign(a, a['k']) = {}</code></pre>
<p>
  and therefore first assign to <code>a</code>, then
  to <code>a['k']</code>.

  That looks like about 9 light minutes away, so about 18 minute

  In practice, if I get a differential equation that I don't recognize
  and I want a closed-form solution, I check out
  <a href="http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/">eqworld.ipmnet.ru</a> or one of
  the books produced by the same folks.  It is like looking up
  integrals in an integral table.  You look up the form of the equation
  you want, then they summarize the solution and cite the proof.

  FemmeAndroid,

<p>
  I've always thought that conference talks should have the traffic
  light system that you get a Toastmasters.
</p>
<p>
  IIRC it's green while you've still got plenty of time, orange when
  you're within x minutes of the scheduled end, and red once you're at
  the scheduled end.
</p>
<p>
  I've found from Toastmasters that a nice bright light at the back of
  the hall is much easier to respond to than a clock or something
  counting down.

  So true!  I always rehearse my talks several times with the

  that's not an obvious thing to people who are getting started and

  I usually don't like it when people sidestep the content of a link,
  to go on some tangent about its typography or aesthetics.
  But <em>damn</em>.  This is a gorgeous looking blog, for using only
  default fonts and minimal CSS.
</p>
<p>
  Apparently the author wrote his

  static site builder in Common Lisp</a>, but it's <em>so</em> minimal
  that the content itself is still written in raw HTML.  It feels
  silly but this just takes me back to happier days (pre-WordPress and
  pre-social media) and makes me wonder why we lost our way.  I dearly
  miss the feeling of making sites like this (but uglier!)  back in
  the 1990's.  Applause.

<p>
  Tome,
</p>
<p>
  At most conferences, the people speaking are not professional
  speakers, and as such I don't mind them running over.
</p>
<p>
  In my experience, it's hard to time a talk correctly, even with
  multiple run throughs ahead of time.  Standing up in front of a big
  crowd, even if I've got a stop watch running I can end up going far
  too quick, or far too slowly, and end up with tunnel vision where I
  fail to identify and correct the mistake.
</p>
<p>
  Are <em>some</em> of the speakers doing it intentionally?  Probably.
  Did some just fail to prepare?  Almost certainly.  But things come
  up, and in the most charitable case, they just stood in front of a
  bunch of people and communicated something they thought was
  important.  I applaud them for that, and move on.

<p>
  This is tangential to the content of the article but I'm continually
  astonished by the number of speakers who seem to be comfortable
  (largely at conferences) running over time cutting into their
  question time, the time of the next speaker, or even worse, lunch!
  Presumably it's not just me and Rota who feel this way, but it seems
  like there must be a large contingent of people who are very
  easygoing about it and quite happy to overrun or listen to
  overrunning speakers.  I would be interested to know the thoughts of
  other readers.

  Had no idea curl could do this.  If you need a deeper dive, you can
  do something similar with Headless Chrome and the Chrome DevTools
  Protocol.
</p>
<p>
  There's a good example with puppeteer
  <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/puppeteer-webperf/blob/2082143/README.md#navigation-timing">here</a>.
  There are other snippets there that you can turn into text command

<h2><a href="https://susam.net/">Susam Pal</a> commented on <a href="../vim-sudo-write-trick.html"><em>Vim Sudo Write Trick</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  RGovostes, Thanks for the interesting idea to make this trick work
  with nano.  Based on your comment, I wrote this script to
  automatically detect the destination filename when invoked
  with <code>^T</code> from nano.
</p>
<pre>
<code>#!/bin/sh
set -e
COMMAND=$(ps -p $PPID -o args=)
FILENAME=${COMMAND#*nano }
printf "Write to $FILENAME? (y/n) "
read ANSWER
[ "$ANSWER" = y ] &amp;&amp; sudo tee "$FILENAME" &lt; "$1" &gt; /dev/null</code>
</pre>
<p>
  After saving this file to, say,
  <code>/usr/local/bin/sudowrite</code>, it can be set up for usage
  like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/sudowrite
export SPELL=/usr/local/bin/sudowrite</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is how to test it:
</p>
<pre>
<code>sudo touch foo.txt
nano foo.txt</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now write some text and try to save it by typing
  <kbd>ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>o</kbd> followed
  by <kbd>enter</kbd>.  The following error should appear:
</p>
<pre><samp>[ Error writing foo.txt: Permission denied ]</samp></pre>
<p>
  Now type <kbd>ctrl</kbd>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<kbd>t</kbd> followed
  by <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>enter</kbd> to save the file successfully
  using the script we wrote above.

<h2>RGovostes commented on <a href="../vim-sudo-write-trick.html"><em>Vim Sudo Write Trick</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  I have often wished there were something equivalent for nano.  Of
  course you can just save to another file and <code>sudo mv</code> it
  into place.
</p>
<p>
  In the spirit of this trick, you could set the <code>SPELL</code>
  environment variable to a script that does
</p>
<pre>
<code>#!/bin/sh
read -p "Path: " FILENAME
cat "$1" | sudo tee "$FILENAME"</code>
</pre>
<p>
  and then invoke it with <code>^T</code> from nano.  Bonus points:
  Extract the destination filename automatically from <code>ps -p
  $PPID -o command=</code> (somewhat portable) or
  from <code>/proc</code> (Linux).

<h2><a href="https://susam.net/">Susam Pal</a> commented on <a href="../vim-sudo-write-trick.html"><em>Vim Sudo Write Trick</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  LP,
</p>
<p>
  Like I explained in my blog post, the quotes around the percent sign
  are necessary to keep the filename as a single argument when the
  filename contains whitespace.  If there is no whitespace in the
  filename, then the quotes are not necessary.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an experiment that demonstrates the purpose of quotes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Enter the following command to create a filename with a space in
      it and then open it with Vim:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo touch "foo bar.txt"
vim "foo bar.txt"</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In Vim, insert some text with the following key sequence:
      <kbd>i</kbd> <kbd>hello</kbd> <kbd>&lt;esc&gt;</kbd>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now enter the following command in Vim to save the file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>:w !sudo tee %</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In another instance of the terminal, enter the following command
      to check the content of the file:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cat "foo bar.txt"</code></pre>
    <p>
      The file still appears empty.  Nothing was saved to this file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Now enter the following commands:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cat foo
cat bar.txt</code></pre>
    <p>
      Both files contain the text <code>hello</code> in them.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This experiment shows that due to the lack of quotes
  around <code>%</code>, the command <code>tee %</code> expands
  to <code>tee foo bar.txt</code> which ends up writing the content of
  the buffer to both files <code>foo</code> and <code>bar.txt</code>
  but not to <code>"foo bar.txt"</code> as we desire.
</p>
<p>
  This is why we need to write <code>tee "%"</code> so that it expands
  to <code>tee "foo bar.txt"</code> and the content of the buffer is
  written to the file named <code>"foo bar.txt"</code>.

  Me too.  I learned Logo in the 90's during 3rd grade.  Now thinking

  Last night I was chatting with my girlfriend (who works as a CAD
  designer in textile industry) about Logo!  Like the author of this
  post, Logo was my first language, and I was really excited to draw
  squares, cubes, and rocket ships, between the ages of 7 and 9.  I
  had a lot of fun experimenting with the audio frequency generation
  as well, composing some basic songs (Ode to Joy, Au Clair De La
  Lune, Fr&egrave;re Jacques).
</p>
<p>
  Years later, when I was 26, I got to use Logo again!  I wanted to
  draw a time-proportional train map of Taiwan.  The distance between
  each point on the map corresponds to the time it takes a local train
  to travel that far.  It made more sense to do that in Logo than in
  any other language.  So I rewrote a basic Logo implementation in
  JavaScript and called it TurtleSheet:
  <a href="http://peterburk.github.io/tra/">http://peterburk.github.io/tra/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I hope that some teachers will see the potential of empowering kids,
  by giving them real-world data like public transport times, and
  getting some real designs out.

  DrCode, You can think of it that way, but you can also think of a
  Logo program as a purely functional computation that follows the
  monad laws.  Here's a Haskell package that implements it:

  DrCode, Well, they say that <em>Logo</em> gave them a taste of
  functional programming, which is a broader statement than turtle
  drawing (which, to be fair, is the bulk of the prior discussion).
  Logo was strongly influenced by Lisp and, consequently, is a
  multi-paradigm language including functional as one of its
  paradigms.

  This was a great blast from the past.  A few friends of mine and I
  would write down instructions to draw crude pictures in Logo; the
  usual sorts of things you'd expect from kids.
</p>
<p>
  I'm sure lots of other kids did the same thing; kind of a fun way to
  sneak into writing programs &mdash;a low barrier to entry, and
  immediate results you could tinker with.

  Is there something popular like this today?

  Lovely post, though it's weird to end in saying that this "gave me a

  the most non-functional, stateful programming paradigm ever

  Sili, Sort of related to games/graphics programming - There's an
  open source CAD program
  called <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> that allows you
  to create 3D models with code that can be simple, but gets complex
  fast.  I personally tried using it to create models for 3D printing,
  but got overwhelmed and decided to go to other tools.

  compose a few of these together and you can manifest some pretty

  Baliex, I had an 8256.  I read some code in a magazine showing how
  to draw fractals recursively (they were Koch snowflakes actually)
  and I had a lot of fun making more complex fractals using that basic

<p>
  "FD 100" was my introduction to programming too!  This short post
  just brought it all back!
</p>
<p>
  I've remembered for years that there was some for-loop syntax that
  I'd used as a kid.  I knew it wasn't <code>for</code> so
  seeing <code>REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RT 1]</code> was quite a revelation
  for me just now!  That's exactly what I was writing back then.  I
  think my first instinct at the time was <code>REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT
  90]</code> and from there went on to draw pentagons, hexagons, and
  then at some point had a eureka moment and tried <code>REPEAT
  360</code> &hellip; mind blown!
</p>
<p>
  I was using an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW#PCW_8256_and_8512">Amstrad
  PCW 8512</a> and would love to hear from anyone else who had a
  similar experience.

  I remember reading about Seymour Papert's Logo back in the 80's and
  getting blown away by how elegant and luxurious the language felt.
  But, the need to start Logo environment first in order to run a
  program kept me away from it so I kept working with BASIC and
  Assembly.  That kind of friction matters a lot.

<h2><a href="https://keybase.io/tristor">Tyler Duzan</a> commented on <a href="../fd-100.html"><em>FD 100</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Logo wasn't the first language I started with (that would be BASIC),
  but it is one I have many fond memories of from childhood.  I used
  Logo later on to program microcontrollers used with Lego to build
  simple robots and machines.  One of my proudest moments was building
  a functional prototype of a washing machine with selectable wash
  cycles.  It allowed me to begin understanding many of the things
  which we find in the world that rely on small embedded electronics
  to function.
</p>
<p>
  I wish there were programs like this for children these days in
  school.  I know Scratch derived from Lego Logo and there's still
  things like Lego Mindstorm, but I don't think there are many common
  programs at least in the US to teach children programming and
  prototyping using these simple mechanisms.

  In a way it's analogous to how Einstein's \( E = mc^2 \) is a

  Agreed, the full formula is much more intersting and deep: it shows
  there is a mapping between the reals and the circle group that
  preserves the structure (turns addition into multiplication).  This
  concept leads to the very general exponential map of a Lie algebra
  to a Lie group and Pontryagin duality, which is the essence of

  We had a running joke in engineering school, that &pi; seconds is
  close to a nanocentury by around 6 nanomonths, we obviously didnt

  6gvONxR4sf7o, Not quite.  The axiom of choice is equivalent to
  saying every vector space has a Hamel basis, which is to say every
  element can be represented as a finite combination of elements of
  the Hamel basis.  It doesn't imply that the Hamel basis is finite
  itself.

<h2>LopsidedBrain commented on <a href="../from-vector-spaces-to-periodic-functions.html"><em>From Vector Spaces to Periodic Functions</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  MathematicsPadawan, It is partly historical notoriety.  It allows
  one to prove certain statements that seem counter-intuitive.  So
  proofs that employ it can often be viewed with some skepticism.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, this axiom is <em>independent</em> of the other axioms in
  ZFC.  It is in fact possible to have entirely self-consistent
  "worlds" of mathematics, ones where the axiom of choice is true, and
  ones where it is false.
</p>
<p>
  More details and examples of alternate axioms are in the Wikipedia
  article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom
  of choice</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If it seems weird that mathematics can give you contradictory
  results, remember that the difference only shows up when you deal
  with some form of infinity (e.g., when performing an operation on an
  infinitely large set).  For any usage of mathematics in the real
  world, the truth or falsity of this axiom won't give you
  contradictory results.

  Im3w1l, Well, sure.  Without choice there exist models of ZF where
  those properties hold.  Adding choice precludes those models, i.e.,
  it restricts our axioms in a way which prevents certain kinds of
  unexpected results.

<p>
  I seem to be missing something.  I'm reading this as looking for
  functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \) to \(
  \mathbb{R}, \) such that \( f(x) + g(x) = 1 \) and \( f(x + p) =
  f(x).  \)  If I were reading that correctly, then for any periodic \(
  f(x), \) \( g(x) = 1 - f(x) \) would do, meaning any old periodic
  function would do.  What am I missing?
</p>
<p>
  Am I also reading it right that the author is saying the axiom of
  choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector space has a
  finite basis?  I don't get how that allows infinite dimensional
  vector spaces.  If not, and it's just that every vector space has a
  basis that maybe infinite, then what's the justification of the
  Hamel basis being finite?
</p>
<p>
  I feel like I'm missing a lot between the lines here.

<p>
  GenerationP,
</p>
<p>
  There are counter-intuitive results in ZF without choice too:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Collection of non-empty sets with empty cartesian product.
  </li>
  <li>
    Infinite set without a countable infinite subset.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a pair of sets such that neither is equinumerous with a
    subset of the other.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  More or less, our intuition about seemingly obvious ideas is
  completely thrown off without choice.  Banach-Tarski at least has
  the property that it probably doesn't directly apply to the real
  world (if you can split an object into probably physically
  impossible sets and then rejoin them correctly then you can double
  the volume of the physical object) and so doesn't really violate our
  intuition &mdash; the premise doesn't apply in the real world, so no
  conclusion really matters.  It's like claiming that every element of
  the empty set is a leprechaun with a pot of gold &mdash; it's true,
  but it doesn't matter in any meaningful sense.

  MathematicsPadawan, Proofs (at least when they are written "the
  usual" way) are human-to-human communication, not human-to-machine
  encoding.  A proof depending on the axiom of choice is a more
  interesting fact than it depending on, say, the axiom schema of
  specification, so it makes sense that the author might want to say
  "hey, pay attention to that".

  MathematicsPadawan, Because it gets you applications like this (or
  the Banach-Tarski paradox), which make you wonder how much it
  deserves its place.  To some extent this is more due to Tertium Non
  Datur than to the axiom of choice, but my impression is ZF doesn't
  know enough about infinite sets to get to the really
  counter-intuitive stuff.

  Yes, the <code>aligned</code> environment is a different
  environment.  The <code>aligned</code> environment is available in
  MathJax too.  This environment is meant to be a part of a larger
  displayed math block, i.e. it goes between <code>\[</code>
  and <code>\]</code> or <code>$$</code> and <code>$$</code>.  The
  <code>align</code> environment, on the other hand, is a standalone
  environment that can be used outside displayed math block.
</p>
<p>
  While the <code>aligned</code> environment is supported by both
  MathJax and KaTeX, the <code>align</code> environment is supported
  by MathJax only.

  For some reason in KaTeX you have to use

  Justin, The problem is that this takes time.  On one PR, sure, okay.
  But if you have 50 of the spammy PRs, even with copy and paste, this
  will take several minutes (maybe up to an hour) of a maintainer's
  day (and really, per day, however long Hacktoberfest goes on).
  That's time that they're not spending coding or updating docs in a
  valid way or spending with family.  It would probably be tenable if
  there were some heuristic that was 100% certain that this was a
  spammy PR, but I'm pretty sure that's not the case.

  But this is not spam.  It's based on morons trying to make it in the
  software world without any basis that they should be there.
</p>
<p>
  They're doing this so that they can put "I have x amount of accepted

  become shit team members or outsourced to become shit offshore team

<h2>Eschborn commented on <a href="../from-vector-spaces-to-periodic-functions.html"><em>From Vector Spaces to Periodic Functions</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  This is a nice example for why the axiom of choice is controversial.
  The proof from this blog post only works because of it.  However,
  the result seems counter-intuitive.  Let us have a look at whether
  this is only our intuition being off or whether functions with these
  properties are just "weird".
</p>
<p>
  When speaking of periodic functions the first that comes to mind is
  the \( \sin \) function.  Can something similar to such a function
  be used to construct the functions \( g \) and \( h \) from the blog
  post?  If we define them similar to \( \sin \) as periodic and
  continuous, then the answer is no.  Every periodic and continuous
  function has a maximum value.  The sum of two functions with a
  maximum value has a maximum value.  However, the identity is
  unbounded.  The sum can therefore not be the identity.
</p>
<p>
  Okay, so \( \sin \)-like functions are out.  What about
  \( \tan \)-like functions?  Take \( \tan(x) \) and \( -\tan(2x) \)
  for example.  Those are not continuous everywhere.  Well, we can
  also rule out many functions like this.  Suppose \( g \) and \( h \)
  are two periodic functions with period lengths \( a \) and \( b.  \)
  If \( \frac{a}{b} \) is rational, then the sum of \( g \) and
  \( h \) cannot be the identity function.  Suppose that \(
  \frac{a}{b} \) was rational, then \( ab \) is a common period of
  both functions, i.e., \( g(x) = g(x + ab) \) and
  \( h(x) = h(x + ab).  \)  It follows that \( (g + h)(x) = (g + h)(x +
  ab).  \)  As \( a \) and \( b \) are non-zero, it follows that \( g +
  h \) cannot be the identity function.  Functions of the form \( a
  \tan(bx) \) for rational \( b \) thus do not work.  Any two periodic
  functions where you can reason about their sum by just looking at
  what happens for individual periods are thus ruled out.
</p>
<p>
  My conclusion is that the two periodic functions from the blog post
  must look "weird".
</p>
<p>
  A common theme with axiom of choice proofs is also that they show
  the existence of something but give no hint at how this something
  actually looks like.  The proof in this blog post is a good example
  of this.  We know that the functions "exist" but have absolutely no
  clue about how they look like.  It is also an open question whether
  describing them in any other way than "the function from this proof"
  is even possible.

  While it may be distasteful, what's the alternative?  Refusing on

  Even if you are doing work for someone else (which, I think, is not

<p>
  Djent, I mentioned in my blog post that there is an SSH gateway in
  between that blocks port forwarding, so your solution is not going
  to work.
</p>
<p>
  For example, say, I run the following command:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh -L 9000:127.0.0.1:8000 HOST</code></pre>
<p>
  Now when I visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:9000/</code> on my local
  system, I get a "connection reset by peer" error.  At the same time,
  on the terminal where I have set up the port forward with the ssh
  command above, I get this error:
</p>
<pre><code>open failed: unknown channel type</code></pre>
<p>
  The SSH gateway forbids port forwarding as well.

  This seems like a CTF trick.  If I were faced with this problem, I

  My solution in these cases:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh HOST tar cjf - /path/to/folder | tar xjf -</code></pre>
<p>
  Basically I ask <code>ssh</code> to execute <code>tar</code> on the
  remote host to create a compressed archive.  <code>ssh</code> will
  output the archive contents on the local host; this data is then
  passed on to a local <code>tar</code> for extraction.

  The instructions in this article should work, but they're more

  Over long periods of time the approximation that a day takes 86400

  astronomical in nature or purely SI in nature.  Hybrid systems like

  it's a relatively young calendar system.

<p>
  I also wish we would change the name of the SI measurement "second".
  An SI second and an astronomical second are two different things,

<h2>Disown commented on <a href="../pointers-in-knr.html"><em>Pointers in K&amp;R</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  K&amp;R is easily one of the best CS/programming books.  Short,
  concise and to the point.
</p>
<p>
  Another way to learn pointers is via assembly.  Either learn
  assembly or just look at the disassembled code.  Look under the hood
  and it'll become clearer.
</p>
<p>
  Of course the best way is to write your own C compiler but that may
  be overkill for most.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/hwayne">Hillel Wayne</a> commented on <a href="../microcentury.html"><em>Microcentury</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  I like this analysis a lot!  But there's one more twist to the
  story: are we even using the right definition of year?  There's
  actually several different ways we can define a year:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    NIST-811 defines the light-year "year" as 365.2500 days and the
    "common year" as 365 days exactly.
  </li>
  <li>
    The sidereal year: the time it takes for the stars to return to a
    fixed point.  That's 365.2563 days.
  </li>
  <li>
    The tropical year: the time between vernal equinoxes.  That's
    365.2421 days.
  </li>
  <li>
    The anomalistic year: the time between points where the earth is
    closest to the sun.  That's 365.2596 days.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For each of these we can define the microcentury as a hundred
  microyears.  So the sidereal microcentury is +35.81 seconds, while
  the tropical microcentury is +35.69 seconds.  The NIST microcentury
  is +33.6 seconds, while the Julian microcentury is +35.76 seconds
  (as you calculated).
</p>
<p>
  Personally, I'd define a calendar microcentury as a four-millionth
  of 400 years to match the leap year cycle.  That'd give us +35.692
  seconds.

<p>
  If we consider optimal attention span, a microcentury is much too
  long.  Two half microcenturies with a pause in between would be
  better.

<h2>Thaumasiotes commented on <a href="../leap-year-test-in-knr.html"><em>Leap Year Test in K&amp;R</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  For those who were curious why these could both work, note that
  <code>(A &amp;&amp; B) || C</code> differs from <code>A &amp;&amp;
  (B || C)</code> in two cases: when <code>A</code> is
  false, <code>C</code> is true, and <code>B</code> is any value.
</p>
<p>
  But in this case in particular, those differences would create a bug
  when <code>A</code> is false (the year is not divisible by 4) at the
  same time that <code>C</code> is true (the year <em>is</em>
  divisible by 400).  Since that can't happen, the bug cannot occur.

  Mine was a Debian 5.  Installed it on a small baremetal server for a

</p>
<p>
  The client went away, and so did I.

<p>
  Then some month ago, the client came back.  The Debian 5 is still

<h2>Geoff Bailey commented on <a href="../temperature-conversion.html"><em>Temperature Conversion</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  An alternative approach to the accurate conversions, that may be
  easier to remember because it is more symmetric, is to first shift
  the temperatures so that the common value (-40) is the zero point,
  then scale, then shift back, that is,

  \begin{align*}
  f &amp; = (c + 40) \cdot \frac{9}{5} - 40, \\
  c &amp; = (f + 40) \cdot \frac{5}{9} - 40.
  \end{align*}

  The formula "looks" the same for each direction, just with inverted
  scaling factors.

  Hahahajaha.  "Middle Endian"!  When will Americans just admit

  Just switch to ISO already so you can keep the month-day sequence,

  Little endian notation is somewhat mixed endian itself, because it
  contains 3 numbers, each number by itself is big endian, but the 3
  numbers are arranged in little endian fashion amongst each other.

  I love the term "middle endianness" and how clearly it highlights

<p>
  FWIW, in my native language, most numbers from 100 and 1000 are

<h2><a href="https://susam.net/">Susam Pal</a> commented on <a href="../lisp-in-vim.html"><em>Lisp in Vim</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  The "vim-slime" plugin is not appropriate for my blog post because
  it is nothing like SLIME.  In fact, the word "slime" in "vim-slime"
  is poorly chosen.  It supports none of the SLIME features.  It does
  not even provide the "connected REPL" experience like SLIME, Slimv
  or Vlime does.  Here are the major reasons why vim-slime is very
  limited and insufficient as a Lisp development environment when
  compared to SLIME, Slimv or Vlime:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    It does not understand s-expressions.  It can only send the
    current text paragraph or text selected in visual mode to a
    terminal running in GNU Screen, tmux, Neovim, etc.  Therefore, it
    cannot send, say, only the current expression or an entire
    function definition or a top-level form to the terminal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since it is language-agnostic and really only sends text from a
    buffer to a terminal, it does not care whether the text is code or
    prose.  It also does not care if the terminal is running a Unix
    shell or a REPL.  It is the user's responsibility to ensure that
    the correct REPL is running on the terminal and the corresponding
    code is being sent from Vim using vim-slime.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since it does not implement the client-server architecture that
    SLIME and Swank implement together, it has none of the interactive
    debugging features of SLIME.  It cannot automatically launch the
    integrated Slime Debugger (SLDB) when an unhandled condition
    occurs.  As a result, all debugging features like inspecting code,
    inspecting variables, etc. are missing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Almost all of the SLIME features are missing from it.  It does not
    support displaying argument lists as we type function calls,
    Common Lisp HyperSpec (CLHS) lookup and completion, describing
    symbols, cross-referencing, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    It does not provide any key-bindings for common tasks such as
    macro expansion, function tracing, etc.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Swank server is an integral component of SLIME.  It is essential to
  the way SLIME works.  A plugin that does not talk to Swank server
  can hardly be anything like SLIME.  Slimv and Vlime on the other
  hand talk to the same Swank server that SLIME talks to.  Slimv and
  Vlime are re-implementations of the client component of SLIME.  They
  send SLIME commands to Swank just like SLIME does.  As a result,
  Slimv and Vlime are able to support a good portion of the features
  available in SLIME.

  I wonder why the author doesn't mention the plugin
  <a href="https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime">vim-slime</a>, given
  that it seems to be more popular than either Slimv or Vlime on
  GitHub.  From what I can gather, Slimv and Vlime are more focused on
  Lisp with built-in completion and debugging whereas vim-slime is
  language agnostic and simply recreates just the "connected REPL"
  behavior of Slime.

  Thank you for this.  We are definitely seeing the declining use of
  centralized domain-resolution.  It has advantages only when it is
  not <em>itself</em> being gamed, and increasingly companies and
  governmental orgs have found ways to do just that.  At the very
  least every domain should have dual central + decentral resolutions,
  and browsers should give you options when the resolutions conflict.

<p>
  Automated legal actions and takedowns like this introduce a lot of
  risk of collateral damage but I wonder what the alternatives are.
</p>
<p>
  The investigators would likely argue that notifying domain holders
  would reduce the chance that they can take down a botnet's
  infrastructure successfully, which seems likely.
</p>
<p>
  Could there be some maximum time after which the 'rule set' for the
  auto-takedown code needs to be made open source/public?  It must
  presumably be implemented as software and/or configuration files.
</p>
<p>
  That would at least allow for inspection, confirmation and disputes
  about how it's implemented, and if this was 30 days or so, it
  shouldn't risk the takedown effort.
</p>
<p>
  While top-tier network engineers are developing takedowns like this,
  presumably they'll do a good job of minimizing false positives - but
  as this case shows, it's not always going to be perfect - and I
  worry that if it becomes more common, we'll see sloppier
  implementations.
</p>
<p>
  That could lead to connectivity and access issues for more users
  (again in an international context).  It's great that the situation
  was resolved in this case but I imagine not all users would be able
  to raise a complaint at a similar level of technical detail and
  respectful tone and for it to receive the same amount of attention.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe that's untrue.  Maybe injustices really do get amplified by
  social media and relying on companies to notice this 'works'.  It
  doesn't sit particularly well with me as a remediation process
  though, and I'm not sure it scales.

<h2>8LJF commented on <a href="../fd-100.html"><em>FD 100</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  The true beauty of Logo comes in the realization that you can add
  your own words to it, and that all these specialist words you devise
  are themselves first-class citizens of the language, of syntax and
  status equal to its generic builtins.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>TO CIRCLE
REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RT 1]
END

TO FLOWER
REPEAT 20 [CIRCLE RT 18]
END</code>
</pre>
<p>
  And so on ad infinitum, until you arrive at a complete custom
  vocabulary that concisely and precisely expresses the particular
  concepts and behaviors of interest and importance to you.  In doing
  so, you move from thinking algorithmically (which is glorified
  spaghetti) to thinking compositionally, which is the key to
  scalability â managing complexity as your needs and ambitions grow.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas Algol-y languages treat user-defined vocabulary as
  second-class citizens, beneath their own privileged built-ins.
  Which is a ridiculous status when you consider which is actually
  important to the user: precise, powerful, tailored words that
  describe their particular problem, or the crude primitive
  undifferentiated building blocks that the language dumps out of the
  box?
</p>
<p>
  The beauty of bottom-up programming, as any Lisp fule know :), is
  that it endlessly tests your own understanding of the problem
  domain: to define effective, productive words you must have some
  idea of what you're talking about; you can't help but learn the
  foundations of the problem space as you go.  There's a basic
  humility to this approach; there's nowhere to hide laziness or
  ignorance.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas in top-down programming it's much too easy for
  highly-educated highly-paid absolute know-nothings to bullshit
  eternally, constructing great theatrical class architectures; grand
  mechanical castles in the sky that look all very difficult and
  impressive to observers while never saying anything relevant or
  useful.
</p>
<p>
  That key switch from algorithmic to compositional thinking is not a
  natural conceptual leap for self-learners â it takes a carefully
  directed prod at a particular point in the learning curve to jump
  those rails â but it opens up worlds.  #PlatosCave

<p>
  Oh man, PC Logo takes me back down the memory lane.  We were
  introduced to PC Logo in 4th grade.  That's about 9 years ago.  I
  instantly fell in love with it.  The amount of power I had over the
  computer - ordering it to draw what I want, how I want, was really
  exciting.
</p>
<p>
  My father had installed Kubuntu on our home computer which had an
  amazing suite of educational applications, including KTurtle which
  was (almost) the same as PC Logo.  I got so addicted to it, my
  father suggested me to create a blog and regularly update it with
  the drawings and the code for
  it.  <a href="http://kturtlecommands.blogspot.com/">And so I
  did!</a>  Good times :).

  Logo was the best!
</p>
<p>
  I still remember my father 'explaining' me Pythagoras theorem when I
  was around 5 to show me how to draw the roof of a house on our
  hand-soldered Philips Apple II clone.
</p>
<p>
  I've been hooked ever since.
</p>
<p>
  The best thing was that 25 years later I opened a Logo emulator
  again and when faced with having to clean the screen somewhere deep,
  deep from my muscle memory the right command sprang
  forward: <code>CLEARSCREEN</code>.

  Nice work.  I was in shock when I saw the splash screen.  I had used
  IBM BASIC from July 1980 until Sept 1983, when I took a Pascal
  class.  I was taking Fortran on the mainframe, Cobol on the mini,
  and Pascal on a PC.  I had seen Logo on a Apple ][ but I was more
  interested in data processing.

  That's correct.  UEFI firmware will execute a PE image (the same
  format that Windows executables use) on a FAT32 file system, and can
  access UEFI services to execute a kernel.

<p>
  The UEFI firmware may support a CSM (compatibility support module)

<h2>u801e commented on <a href="../temperature-conversion.html"><em>Temperature Conversion</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  The way I convert is to remember that 32&nbsp;&deg;F is
  0&nbsp;&deg;C and then count by "nines" for Fahrenheit to get the
  desired temperature in Celsius.
</p>
<p>
  32&nbsp;&deg;F =  0&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  41&nbsp;&deg;F =  5&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  50&nbsp;&deg;F = 10&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  59&nbsp;&deg;F = 15&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  68&nbsp;&deg;F = 20&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  77&nbsp;&deg;F = 25&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  86&nbsp;&deg;F = 30&nbsp;&deg;C<br>
  95&nbsp;&deg;F = 35&nbsp;&deg;C
</p>
<p>
  It's also pretty easy to remember that 10&nbsp;&deg;C =
  50&nbsp;&deg;F and 35&nbsp;&deg;C = 95&nbsp;&deg;F if you want to go
  forward or back from there with the same counting method.

<h2><a href="https://susam.net/">Susam Pal</a> commented on <a href="../auth-cram-md5.html"><em>AUTH CRAM-MD5</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Matt, you make a very good point.  Yes, the server needs to store
  the passwords in plaintext in case of CRAM-MD5 authentication so
  that it can compute the expected response and match it with the
  received response.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a sample entry in the /etc/exim4/passwd file for the
  curious:
</p>
<pre><code>alice:$1$vRPkzzDi$3sqk2e4Jcgn/YEeB1JqgT1</code></pre>
<p>
  In case of PLAIN or LOGIN authentication mechanism, the above entry
  is enough to setup the user 'alice' with password 'wonderland' that
  has been used in this post.  In this example, the second field
  contains the password hashed with MD5 and a random salt.  After the
  server receives the password from the client, it would compute a
  hash from the password using the same hashing algorithm and salt
  (<code>vRPkzzDi</code> in this case) and check that the result
  matches with the hash in this file.
</p>
<p>
  For CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanism to work properly, we'll need
  an entry like this in the <code>passwd</code> file.
</p>
<pre><code>alice:$1$vRPkzzDi$3sqk2e4Jcgn/YEeB1JqgT1:wonderland</code></pre>
<p>
  Strictly speaking, the second field is not necessary.  It could have
  been empty since only the third field containing the password in
  plaintext is used to compute the expected response to the challenge
  during CRAM-MD5 authentication.

<h2>Matt Mullins commented on <a href="../auth-cram-md5.html"><em>AUTH CRAM-MD5</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  The problem with challenge-response authentication, however, is that
  it requires the server to store passwords in plaintext.  There are
  very few servers I trust enough to store my password without
  properly hashing it first.
</p>
<p>
  In practice, most systems use PLAIN authentication over a secured
  connection, such as by SSL, so that it's not susceptible to the
  man-in-the-middle problem described.
</p>
<p>
  You can also use Kerberos through GSSAPI to trust a single source
  for authentication tickets.  A Kerberos key distribution center does
  store password-equivalent data as plain-text, but it minimizes the
  number of systems that need to be protected to such a high degree.

  This only works with one face used for both the 6 and 9.
</p>
<p>
  Both cubes need to have 0, 1 and 2.  The remaining six digits can be
  assigned to the cubes in \( \binom{6}{3} / 2 = 10 \) ways.
</p>
<p>
  There are 5 choices for a number to go on the face opposite the
  zero.  Then put the lowest remaining number on an open face, and
  there are 3 choices for a number to go opposite that one.
</p>
<p>
  There are 2 choices for how to arrange the final two digits.
</p>
<p>
  So now we are up to \( 10 \cdot 30^2 = 9000 \) unique ways to assign
  digits to the faces.

<h2>Joshua Tobin commented on <a href="../magical-chameleons-puzzle.html"><em>Magical Chameleons Puzzle</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Some notation: I use tuples \( (r, g, b) \) to represent the numbers
  of chameleons of each colour at any given time.  The transformation
  \( (r', g', b') \to (r, g, b) \) denotes that the number of red,
  blue, and green chameleons changed from \( (r', g', b') \) to \( (r,
  g, b).  \)  Then I work backwards in time.  So, if there are \( (r,
  g, b) \) chameleons now, the previous transformation must have been
  one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( (r - 2x, g + x, b + x) \to (r, g, b) \)</li>
  <li>\( (r + x, g - 2x, b + x) \to (r, g, b) \)</li>
  <li>\( (r + x, g + x, b - 2x) \to (r, g, b) \)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let \( d \) be the number of blue chameleons when the zoologists
  first arrived.
</p>
<p>
  We know that when the zoologists arrived for the first time, they
  observed \( (2000, 3000, d).  \)  We also know that when they arrived
  for the second time, they observed \( (5000 + d, 0, 0).  \)  The
  question is: what are the possible values of \( d?  \)  I answer this
  in two parts.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Part 1.</strong> <em>The integer \( d \) must be a multiple
  of 3.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> Let us look at how each number in the tuple change
  modulo 3 for each possible transformation.  For example, without
  loss of generality, consider the transformation \( (r - 2x, g + x, b
  + 2x) \to (r, g, b).  \)  Note that \( -2x \equiv x \pmod{3}.  \)  So
  every transformation just adds the same number modulo 3 to each
  number in the tuple.
</p>
<p>
  We know that we start with \( (2000, 3000, d) \) and reach \( (5000
  + d, 0, 0).  \)  Since the values of green and blue are congruent
  modulo 3 in the end (both are 0), therefore their values must be
  congruent modulo 3 at the start.  Hence \( d \equiv 0 \pmod{3}.  \)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Part 2.</strong>
  <em>
    If \( d \) is any multiple of 3 we can find a sequence of
    transformations to go from \( (2000, 3000, d) \) to \( (5000 + d,
    0, 0).  \)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof</em>.  Consider \( (r, g, b) \) where \( r \ge 1 \) and \(
  g \ge 3.  \)  We can get

  \[
    (r, g, b) \to (r - 1, g - 1, b + 2) \to (r + 3, g - 3, b).
  \]

  This means that we can keep taking 3 from the value of green and
  keep adding it to the value of red.  So if we start with \( (2000,
  3000, d, \) we can can get \( (5000, 0, d).  \)
</p>
<p>
  Similarly for \( r \ge 1 \) and \( b \ge 3, \) we can get

  \[
    (r, g, b) \to (r - 1, g + 2, b - 1) \to (r + 3, g, b - 3).
  \]

  So we can keep taking 3 from the value of blue and keep adding it to
  the value of red.  If \( d \) is a multiple of 3, we can use this to
  go from \( (5000, 0, d) \) to \( (5000 + d, 0, 0).  \)

<h2>Ryan Batterman commented on <a href="../shrinking-list-puzzle.html"><em>Shrinking List Puzzle</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Let \( f(x, y) = x + y + xy.  \)  It can be rewritten as \( f(x, y) =
  (x + 1)(y + 1) - 1.  \)  Now, consider an arbitrary set of integers
  \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}.  \)  Applying the algorithm
  mentioned in the problem statement to two integers \( a_i \) and \(
  a_j \) chosen randomly from the set such that \( i \ne j, \) we
  obtain, \( f(a_i, a_j) = (a_i + 1)(b_i + 1) - 1.  \)  When this
  expression is used in subsequent calls to \( f(x, y), \) the
  \( -1 \) drops, the new number is included in the product and the \(
  -1 \) gets added again.  For instance, using this result and a
  different number \( a_k \) chosen randomly from the set, we obtain
  \( f\bigl((a_i + 1)(a_j + 1) - 1, a_k\bigr) = (a_i + 1)(a_j + 1)(a_k
  + 1) - 1.  \)  Inductively, this pattern holds, and the algorithm
  returns a product of all integers in the set minus \( 1.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, the result of the algorithm, when applied to the set
  \( A \) is \( \prod_{i=1}^n (a_i + 1) - 1.  \)  If \( A = \{1, 2,
  \dots, 9\}, \) on applying the algorithm, we obtain \( (1 + 1)(2 +
  1) \dots (9 + 1) - 1 = 10!  - 1 = 3628799.  \)

<p>
  Yes, the correct answer is 4.  There are indeed 25519 ten-digit
  multiples of 234 which have 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 as nine of
  its digits.  The remaining digit must be 4.  We need not brute force
  to confirm this.  It can be proven logically.
</p>
<p>
  The number 234 is a multiple of 9.  So any multiple of 234 is also a
  multiple of 9.  We know that the sum of all digits of a multiple of
  9 is a multiple of 9.  If we assume the remaining digit to be
  \( x, \) the sum of the digits of the multiple in question is \( 0 +
  1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 9 + x = 32 + x.  \)  The only value of
  digit \( x \) that makes \( 32 + x \) a multiple of 9 is 4.

  Well, the reason why the same or similar questions arise is simple.
  People, out of ignorance, read wrong books and there are very few
  who can guide them to use the right books and the right
  platform/environment to learn C.  The Indian market is full of books
  that <em>still</em> teach C using Turbo C and the
  questions/exercises contain precisely questions about these.  Many
  of the examples in such books include <code>conio.h</code>!

  The <code>float8_accum</code> is the aggregate state transition
  function which maintains an internal state which changes for every
  new <code>float8</code> input value.
</p>
<p>
  It requires a three-element array, not just two elements, because it
  accumulates the sum of squares as well as the sum and count of the
  inputs.  This is so that it can be used for some other aggregates
  besides <code>avg</code>.

  The places near the South Pole are infinitely many.  Some of them
  lie on the circle that is \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2\pi} \right) \) km
  from the pole.  Then you'll walk 1 km towards the pole, then circle
  it (1 km) and walk back 1 km in the same track away from the pole.
  Some other of them lie on the circle that is \( \left( 1 +
  \frac{1}{4\pi} \right) \) km, you do the same but you circle the
  pole twice.  Thus the starting point could be the North Pole or any

  space-efficient probabilistic data structure.  At RSA, we develop
  software products for security operations centre (SOC) that parse,
  index and query petabytes of security events.  We use bloom filters
  to speed up queries in the querying engine of these products while
  occupying less storage space than a traditional inverted index.

  Good article.  This is how buffer overflow is exploited.  But I

  Prunthaban,
</p>
<p>
  Your solution is pretty much what I had in mind too.  I proposed
  this solution to the factory management and it was successfully
  implemented in the factory.  I have updated my blog post with these
  details.  Thank you for participating in this discussion and
  offering your solution.

<h2><a href="https://twitter.com/pruntz">Prunthaban</a> commented on <a href="../illiteracy-and-digital-weighing-scale.html"><em>Illiteracy and Digital Weighing Scale</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  Here is my solution: Most digital scales have a button called "Set
  to 0".  Let us say I want the people to weigh 5.3&nbsp;kg.  I keep
  5.3&nbsp;kg weight on the scale and press "Set to 0".  After I
  remove this weight, it shows "-5.3".  Now the worker only needs to
  pour until the scale shows "0.0".  The worker just needs to know "0"
  to do this.  To know whether to pour more or remove from the
  balance, the worker just needs to look at the "-" sign.  If it is
  there keep pouring, else remove.  :-) So the worker can achieve the
  task by remembering "0.0" and "-" signs.

<p>
  Veera,
</p>
<p>
  Your solution would work fine if the factory had some control on the
  design of the digital weighing scale.  However in this case, the
  factory has no control on the design of the digital weighing scale.
  They have to work with what they have.  Therefore your solution will
  not work in practice.

<p>
  The digital balance has to be designed in such a way that a given
  weight can be preset.  When the worker fills the bucket and the
  total weight reaches the preset value, the digital balance can alert
  the worker either by showing a green light or by beeping.  The
  worker must be able to notice this alert and stop filling more.

<p>
  Vivek,
</p>
<p>
  In a beam balance, once a supervisor tells them which weights to
  use, their job is easy.  They only need to keep pouring material
  until the beam becomes balanced.  If the beam tilts towards the pan
  with the material, then they need to remove material.
</p>
<p>
  With a digital scale, however, the usage becomes more complicated
  than it sounds in your comment.  Let us say the workers are supposed
  to pour 5.3&nbsp;kg of material.  They pour a little too much
  material and the scale shoots up to 6.2&nbsp;kg.  Since the workers
  cannot read the digits, they don't know whether they should keep
  pouring more material or remove material.

<h2>MS Vivek Chaitanya commented on <a href="../illiteracy-and-digital-weighing-scale.html"><em>Illiteracy and Digital Weighing Scale</em></a>:</h2>
<p>
  It is difficult for an illiterate worker to use a beam balance too
  because the worker may not know what denominations of weights to put
  in one pan.
</p>
<p>
  It is easier for an illiterate worker to use a digital scale because
  it shows the numbers.  You can print all the weights on a paper,
  give it to them and ask them to put the material until the number in
  the paper matches the number in the meter.

<p>
  Veetrag, These kinds of questions actually have a clear answer: they
  invoke undefined behaviour.  When someone writes code that relies on
  undefined behaviour or tries to predict what it will do, it's often
  a sign that that there's a gap in understanding of how the language
  works.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding undefined behaviour is important for any professional
  software developer working in C.  Writing C code without a solid
  grasp of this concept can lead to software that is fragile and
  insecure.

  I completely agree with what you are trying to say.  I tried to
  explain the same stuff 6 years back when I was put incharge of
  designing questions for a programming competition.  I tried to
  explain it to organizers how ambiguous these questions can be,
  considering the fact that most participants/compilers do not follow
  the ANSI standard properly.  Secondly, these questions are not real
  test of programming skills, they are just some gimmicks to 'wow'
  people, real life programming is much different.

  Yes, the POSIX specification seems to allow implementations to use
  non-alphanumeric characters in function names too.  Quoting the
  relevant paragraph from POSIX.1-2001 specification:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The function is named <em>fname</em>; the application shall ensure
  that it is a name (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std
  1003.1-2001, Section 3.230, Name).  An implementation may allow
  other characters in a function name as an extension.  The
  implementation shall maintain separate name spaces for functions and
  variables.

  Nice work on the website.  I like the clean design.  These days, most
  new websites have pitch-black backgrounds with moving banners that
  are hard to read.  Yours is clean and easy to follow.  The articles
  are very informative too.  I really like your website.

  This is a really nice website with a clean layout.  Sharing
  computing articles is a genius way to get your website noticed and
  attract readers who genuinely care about the subject.  Keep up the
  great work!
