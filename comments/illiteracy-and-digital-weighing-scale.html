  It is difficult for an illiterate worker to use a beam balance too
  because the worker may not know what denominations of weights to put
  in one pan.

  It is easier for an illiterate worker to use a digital scale because
  it shows the numbers.  You can print all the weights on a paper,
  give it to them and ask them to put the material until the number in
  the paper matches the number in the meter.

  Vivek,
</p>
<p>
  In a beam balance, once a supervisor tells them which weights to
  use, their job is easy.  They only need to keep pouring material
  until the beam becomes balanced.  If the beam tilts towards the pan
  with the material, then they need to remove material.
</p>
<p>
  With a digital scale, however, the usage becomes more complicated
  than it sounds in your comment.  Let us say the workers are supposed
  to pour 5.3&nbsp;kg of material.  They pour a little too much
  material and the scale shoots up to 6.2&nbsp;kg.  Since the workers
  cannot read the digits, they don't know whether they should keep
  pouring more material or remove material.

  The digital balance has to be designed in such a way that a given
  weight can be preset.  When the worker fills the bucket and the
  total weight reaches the preset value, the digital balance can alert
  the worker either by showing a green light or by beeping.  The
  worker must be able to notice this alert and stop filling more.

  Veera,
</p>
<p>
  Your solution would work fine if the factory had some control on the
  design of the digital weighing scale.  However in this case, the
  factory has no control on the design of the digital weighing scale.
  They have to work with what they have.  Therefore your solution will
  not work in practice.

  Here is my solution: Most digital scales have a button called "Set
  to 0".  Let us say I want the people to weigh 5.3&nbsp;kg.  I keep
  5.3&nbsp;kg weight on the scale and press "Set to 0".  After I
  remove this weight, it shows "-5.3".  Now the worker only needs to
  pour until the scale shows "0.0".  The worker just needs to know "0"
  to do this.  To know whether to pour more or remove from the
  balance, the worker just needs to look at the "-" sign.  If it is
  there keep pouring, else remove.  :-) So the worker can achieve the
  task by remembering "0.0" and "-" signs.

  Prunthaban,
</p>
<p>
  Your solution is pretty much what I had in mind too.  I proposed
  this solution to the factory management and it was successfully
  implemented in the factory.  I have updated my blog post with these
  details.  Thank you for participating in this discussion and
  offering your solution.
