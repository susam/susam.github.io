  I completely agree with what you are trying to say.  I tried to
  explain the same stuff 6 years back when I was put incharge of
  designing questions for a programming competition.  I tried to
  explain it to organizers how ambiguous these questions can be,
  considering the fact that most participants/compilers do not follow
  the ANSI standard properly.  Secondly, these questions are not real
  test of programming skills, they are just some gimmicks to 'wow'
  people, real life programming is much different.

  Veetrag, These kinds of questions actually have a clear answer: they
  invoke undefined behaviour.  When someone writes code that relies on
  undefined behaviour or tries to predict what it will do, it's often
  a sign that that there's a gap in understanding of how the language
  works.
</p>
<p>
  Understanding undefined behaviour is important for any professional
  software developer working in C.  Writing C code without a solid
  grasp of this concept can lead to software that is fragile and
  insecure.

  There are other features also in other programming languages like
  threading in Java which is completely dependent on JVM behavior
  or <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/04/garbage-collection-in-java.html">garbage
  collection in Java</a> which varies across JVM to JVM.

  Well, the reason why the same or similar questions arise is simple.
  People, out of ignorance, read wrong books and there are very few
  who can guide them to use the right books and the right
  platform/environment to learn C.  The Indian market is full of books
  that <em>still</em> teach C using Turbo C and the
  questions/exercises contain precisely questions about these.  Many
  of the examples in such books include <code>conio.h</code>!
