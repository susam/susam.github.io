  I still remember my father 'explaining' me Pythagoras theorem when I

<p>
  I've been hooked ever since.

  The best thing was that 25 years later I opened a Logo emulator
  again and when faced with having to clean the screen somewhere deep,
  deep from my muscle memory the right command sprang
  forward: <code>CLEARSCREEN</code>.

  Oh man, PC Logo takes me back down the memory lane.  We were
  introduced to PC Logo in 4th grade.  That's about 9 years ago.  I
  instantly fell in love with it.  The amount of power I had over the
  computer - ordering it to draw what I want, how I want, was really
  exciting.
</p>
<p>
  My father had installed Kubuntu on our home computer which had an
  amazing suite of educational applications, including KTurtle which
  was (almost) the same as PC Logo.  I got so addicted to it, my
  father suggested me to create a blog and regularly update it with
  the drawings and the code for
  it.  <a href="http://kturtlecommands.blogspot.com/">And so I
  did!</a>  Good times :).

  The true beauty of Logo comes in the realization that you can add
  your own words to it, and that all these specialist words you devise
  are themselves first-class citizens of the language, of syntax and
  status equal to its generic builtins.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
<code>TO CIRCLE
REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RT 1]
END

TO FLOWER
REPEAT 20 [CIRCLE RT 18]
END</code>
</pre>
<p>
  And so on ad infinitum, until you arrive at a complete custom
  vocabulary that concisely and precisely expresses the particular
  concepts and behaviors of interest and importance to you.  In doing
  so, you move from thinking algorithmically (which is glorified
  spaghetti) to thinking compositionally, which is the key to
  scalability – managing complexity as your needs and ambitions grow.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas Algol-y languages treat user-defined vocabulary as
  second-class citizens, beneath their own privileged built-ins.
  Which is a ridiculous status when you consider which is actually
  important to the user: precise, powerful, tailored words that
  describe their particular problem, or the crude primitive
  undifferentiated building blocks that the language dumps out of the
  box?
</p>
<p>
  The beauty of bottom-up programming, as any Lisp fule know :), is
  that it endlessly tests your own understanding of the problem
  domain: to define effective, productive words you must have some
  idea of what you're talking about; you can't help but learn the
  foundations of the problem space as you go.  There's a basic
  humility to this approach; there's nowhere to hide laziness or
  ignorance.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas in top-down programming it's much too easy for
  highly-educated highly-paid absolute know-nothings to bullshit
  eternally, constructing great theatrical class architectures; grand
  mechanical castles in the sky that look all very difficult and
  impressive to observers while never saying anything relevant or
  useful.
</p>
<p>
  That key switch from algorithmic to compositional thinking is not a
  natural conceptual leap for self-learners – it takes a carefully
  directed prod at a particular point in the learning curve to jump
  those rails – but it opens up worlds.  #PlatosCave

  Thanks for sharing.  What a cool story!  That must have been a

<p>
  It's a great image because it reminds me exactly of what we used to
  do, especially the <code>REPEAT 180</code> with <code>RT 2</code>
  instead of <code>REPEAT 360</code> to avoid repeating the circle
  twice since the circle looks the same anyway on those monitors.
  Once you move up to <code>RT 3</code> or more it begins to look a
  bit more like a polygon.

  Logo wasn't the first language I started with (that would be BASIC),
  but it is one I have many fond memories of from childhood.  I used
  Logo later on to program microcontrollers used with Lego to build
  simple robots and machines.  One of my proudest moments was building
  a functional prototype of a washing machine with selectable wash
  cycles.  It allowed me to begin understanding many of the things
  which we find in the world that rely on small embedded electronics
  to function.
</p>
<p>
  I wish there were programs like this for children these days in
  school.  I know Scratch derived from Lego Logo and there's still
  things like Lego Mindstorm, but I don't think there are many common
  programs at least in the US to teach children programming and
  prototyping using these simple mechanisms.

  I remember reading about Seymour Papert's Logo back in the 80's and
  getting blown away by how elegant and luxurious the language felt.
  But, the need to start Logo environment first in order to run a
  program kept me away from it so I kept working with BASIC and
  Assembly.  That kind of friction matters a lot.

  "FD 100" was my introduction to programming too!  This short post
  just brought it all back!

<p>
  I've remembered for years that there was some for-loop syntax that
  I'd used as a kid.  I knew it wasn't <code>for</code> so
  seeing <code>REPEAT 360 [FD 1 RT 1]</code> was quite a revelation
  for me just now!  That's exactly what I was writing back then.  I
  think my first instinct at the time was <code>REPEAT 4 [FD 100 RT
  90]</code> and from there went on to draw pentagons, hexagons, and
  then at some point had a eureka moment and tried <code>REPEAT
  360</code> &hellip; mind blown!

  I was using an

  Baliex, I had an 8256.  I read some code in a magazine showing how
  to draw fractals recursively (they were Koch snowflakes actually)
  and I had a lot of fun making more complex fractals using that basic
  recipe.  The PCWs had a monochrome screen that was quite hi-res,
  certainly compared to what I was used to, which worked well for
  turtle graphics.

  <a href="https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm">https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm</a>

  Sili, Sort of related to games/graphics programming - There's an
  open source CAD program
  called <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> that allows you
  to create 3D models with code that can be simple, but gets complex
  fast.  I personally tried using it to create models for 3D printing,

  DrCode, Well, they say that <em>Logo</em> gave them a taste of
  functional programming, which is a broader statement than turtle
  drawing (which, to be fair, is the bulk of the prior discussion).
  Logo was strongly influenced by Lisp and, consequently, is a
  multi-paradigm language including functional as one of its
  paradigms.

  Last night I was chatting with my girlfriend (who works as a CAD
  designer in textile industry) about Logo!  Like the author of this
  post, Logo was my first language, and I was really excited to draw
  squares, cubes, and rocket ships, between the ages of 7 and 9.  I
  had a lot of fun experimenting with the audio frequency generation
  as well, composing some basic songs (Ode to Joy, Au Clair De La
  Lune, Fr&egrave;re Jacques).
</p>
<p>
  Years later, when I was 26, I got to use Logo again!  I wanted to
  draw a time-proportional train map of Taiwan.  The distance between
  each point on the map corresponds to the time it takes a local train
  to travel that far.  It made more sense to do that in Logo than in
  any other language.  So I rewrote a basic Logo implementation in
  JavaScript and called it TurtleSheet:
  <a href="http://peterburk.github.io/tra/">http://peterburk.github.io/tra/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I hope that some teachers will see the potential of empowering kids,
  by giving them real-world data like public transport times, and
  getting some real designs out.

  I think this kind of experience is missing for kids now – but I'd

  a lot more between the kid and the computer.  When a CLI is your
  interface, making even rudimentary graphics feels like achieving
  magic.  When your interface is a cell phone or GUI, there's a much
  larger leap from zero to "feels like magic" – OK, so I made a circle

  I agree 100% with the author -- logo as a child is what started me
  on programming.  My first programming experience was in ~1981 or so
  when my elementary school teacher brought an Apple II into our

  from her college.  It was loaded with Apple Logo, and you had to pry
  me away from it with a crowbar.  That was one of the first times I
  stayed after school willingly.  I hounded my parents mercilessly

  I eventually learned BASIC, and learned debugging and "hacking" by
  fixing the games that I typed in (incorrectly) from magazines and
  modifying them to do different things.

  Such great memories!  Logo, then moving on to Basic on the VTech
  PreComputer 1000, then GW-BASIC on PC (which to this day I never
  figured out how to exit!  I used to turn the computer off and on
  again).

  We had a Logo turtle at school in the late 80s I guess.  I can't
  remember if it was hooked up to the BBC Micros or the RM Nimbus
  pseudo-PC that were popular in UK schools at the time.  But either
  way, it seemed amazingly cool.

  This is what Unix pipes did for me.  By the time I started
  programming, constructing programs as series of side effect-free
  transformations felt perfectly natural.  To be precise I did have
  some previous imperative programming experience and I didn't like it
  or grok it.

  It seems a pretty common thing to have a pleasant nostalgic memory
  of Logo as a fun introduction to programming.  My experience with it
  was pretty different.  I found it pretty pointless and boring at the
  time.  It didn't have any pull on me the way C later did.
</p>
<p>
  Ironically, a big part of what made C fun for me were the Borland
  conio (console I/O) and graphics libraries.  Those were fun only
  because I could respond to user interactions and make simple games
  and other playful things.  Looking back on it, that was probably the
  missing ingredient with Logo for me.  We were never taught any ways
  of user input.  They were just static programs that did one thing
  and that feels fundamentally different.

  Great article!  :) I spend my days
  developing <a href="https://turtlespaces.org/">turtleSpaces</a>, a
  modern 3D environment for coding in Logo, based on the Apple Logo II
  implementation (and greatly expanded upon).  Like the original Logos
  it has a REPL and you can just type <code>FD 100</code> and the
  turtle will happily move as expected.
</p>
<p>
  It's written in Go, and as such has builds for macOS, Linux and
  Windows, as well as a WebAssembly build which runs inside of a
  Javascript-based IDE.  We still have a ways to go to reach our goal
  of a Logo-based multi-player 3D game engine (like Roblox) but you
  can do a great deal with it as it stands now, including creating STL
  files for 3D printing and making simple games and animations.

  I did the "heathkit" version of programming: Typing in BASIC code
  for a version of lunar lander on a TRS-80 on the sale floor of my
  local Radio Shack.
</p>
<p>
  Later I learned to write my own kits.  And sometime after that, I
  got others to pay me for the pleasure - Winning!

  My first programming language (aside from HP-12C routines) was COMAL
  on the C64.  COMAL was advertised as being halfway between BASIC and
  PASCAL, and it also had Logo turtle graphics and featured a
  corresponding split screen text/graphics view.  Great times.
