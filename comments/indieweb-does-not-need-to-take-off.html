  I totally resonate with the sentiment.  Nowadays it seems that more
  people than before are afraid to get into something new for the joy
  of it unless there's already a broad appeal.  Personally I attribute
  it to a weird kind of "fear of missing out" in which the individual
  prefers to not commit because of opportunity cost.  What if
  something cooler comes along and what I'm already invested in
  doesn't catch on?  Better do nothing then.
</p>
<p>
  All this basically boils down to mixing external validation with inner joy, I guess?

<p>
  Off-topic: Thank you for
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/devil">Devil</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/susam/emfy">Emfy</a>.  They're
  great!  Emfy really demystified Emacs config the second time I got
  around to learning Emacs.
</p>
<p>
  And also pretty please with a cherry on top when you have some time
  to spare will you take a look at the pull request
  for <code>which-key</code> integration in <code>devil-mode</code>?
  I apologize in advance for pestering you with this.  Also I'm not
  the author of that pull request just to be clear.
</p>
<p>
  Love your stuff!  &lt;3

  Thank you, AquariusDue, for your kind words.  Unfortunately, I've
  not had the time to look into the <code>which-key</code>
  contribution yet.  I definitely plan to look into it, but it may
  take some time.  I've been juggling other responsibilities lately,
  so I'm currently taking a break from open-source maintenance
  activities.  When I can spare the time again, I will focus on
  reviewing the open PRs PRs for <code>devil-mode</code>.

  Hello Matej!  This website is primarily written in plain HTML.  I
  also have a little Common Lisp program to add common headers and
  footers to the pages, generate tag pages, publish web feeds, etc.
  See <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net">github.com/susam/susam.net</a>
  for the source code.
