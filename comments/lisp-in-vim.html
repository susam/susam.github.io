  IMHO a very well-written article with great attention to detail.  I
  especially liked the section on paredit with its step-by-step
  explanation.

  I wonder why the author doesn't mention the plugin
  <a href="https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime">vim-slime</a>, given
  that it seems to be more popular than either Slimv or Vlime on
  GitHub.  From what I can gather, Slimv and Vlime are more focused on
  Lisp with built-in completion and debugging whereas vim-slime is
  language agnostic and simply recreates just the "connected REPL"
  behavior of Slime.

  The "vim-slime" plugin is not appropriate for my blog post because
  it is nothing like SLIME.  In fact, the word "slime" in "vim-slime"
  is poorly chosen.  It supports none of the SLIME features.  It does
  not even provide the "connected REPL" experience like SLIME, Slimv
  or Vlime does.  Here are the major reasons why vim-slime is very
  limited and insufficient as a Lisp development environment when
  compared to SLIME, Slimv or Vlime:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    It does not understand s-expressions.  It can only send the
    current text paragraph or text selected in visual mode to a
    terminal running in GNU Screen, tmux, Neovim, etc.  Therefore, it
    cannot send, say, only the current expression or an entire
    function definition or a top-level form to the terminal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since it is language-agnostic and really only sends text from a
    buffer to a terminal, it does not care whether the text is code or
    prose.  It also does not care if the terminal is running a Unix
    shell or a REPL.  It is the user's responsibility to ensure that
    the correct REPL is running on the terminal and the corresponding
    code is being sent from Vim using vim-slime.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since it does not implement the client-server architecture that
    SLIME and Swank implement together, it has none of the interactive
    debugging features of SLIME.  It cannot automatically launch the
    integrated Slime Debugger (SLDB) when an unhandled condition
    occurs.  As a result, all debugging features like inspecting code,
    inspecting variables, etc. are missing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Almost all of the SLIME features are missing from it.  It does not
    support displaying argument lists as we type function calls,
    Common Lisp HyperSpec (CLHS) lookup and completion, describing
    symbols, cross-referencing, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    It does not provide any key-bindings for common tasks such as
    macro expansion, function tracing, etc.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Swank server is an integral component of SLIME.  It is essential to
  the way SLIME works.  A plugin that does not talk to Swank server
  can hardly be anything like SLIME.  Slimv and Vlime on the other
  hand talk to the same Swank server that SLIME talks to.  Slimv and
  Vlime are re-implementations of the client component of SLIME.  They
  send SLIME commands to Swank just like SLIME does.  As a result,
  Slimv and Vlime are able to support a good portion of the features
  available in SLIME.

  Such a great article.
</p>
<p>
  I really wish though there is a button to turn on and off so one can
  read only about Slimv or Vlime or both.

  This is great!  I just recently started using Vlime and had been
  starting SBCL externally but
  your <kbd>\</kbd><kbd>r</kbd><kbd>r</kbd> hotkey has just saved me
  lots of annoyance!
</p>
<p>
  Same with the interactive debugging, I didn't know you could inspect
  the call stack like that and evaluate stuff!  I only knew about
  choosing restarts.  Thanks for this write up!

  I <em>love</em> the level of details of this write-up.
</p>
<p>
  It assumes nothing and tries really hard to avoid you any papercuts.
  I wish I had found when I tried to learn Lisp.  Between learning the
  language and all the papercuts I just gave up like I did for so many
  other niche things that caught my interest.

  Still the best article on setting up Vim with lisp in 2024.  Great
  resource!
