  Nickname management is complicated.  I like to use the same nickname
  from multiple IRC clients running on multiple systems.  It used to
  work earlier but not any more.  Recovering a nickname after you've
  forgotten the password is also complicated.  If you don't care about
  nicknames, the issue is moot but maintaining a consistent identity
  seems important.

  Nice article.  Thanks!  :-) I grew up with IRC and realize that it
  isn't the same any longer.  It isn't the place where everyone is,
  which some social networks seem to be today.  The local communities
  on IRC, a channel for a town used to be the place to be and meet
  others.

  Same with SMTP and POP.  I would routinely send or get email via
  telnet when I wanted to debug or delete some messages.  They're all
  very simple protocols.

  It's a real shame how difficult programming is.  I don't mean that
  it is difficult to write difficult things, but that it is difficult
  to write simple things.  Once upon a time, one could download Visual
  Studio, click about to make a new project in, for example, Visual
  Basic, draw a GUI in the GUI editor, and click the run button.  One
  could then start adding simple functionality (e.g., working through
  a book).  Or even longer ago when a computer might dump you
  practically straight into BASIC when you turned it on or you might
  get access to a mainframe/minicomputer with programming tools
  already set up.  Nowadays, an "easy" introduction could involve the
  horrific process of installing and setting up Python on Windows
  (where it is hard to do things other than input/output text) or
  editing some HTML/JavaScript files where there are more easily
  possible interactive things but lots of things are difficult like
  <em>just drawing things</em> or anything that requires a server
  side.
</p>
<p>
  If you, like me, were wondering what Libera Chat is, it's the moral
  successor of Freenode with Freenode now being a shell of its former
  self.

  A number of moons ago, I switched from a company that used IRC for
  its internal, real-time, ephemeral communication needs to an
  enterprise shop that used Microsoft Teams to do that (and of course
  other communication stuff, as the boundaries for what was better
  kept in Sharepoint, Confluence, Email/Exchange, the legacy Wiki,
  and/or Teams were never quite clear :)) there.
</p>
<p>
  In the old shop, we eventually had all kinds of important subsystems
  hooked up to our internal IRC server: Monitoring and alerting.
  Source control and Wiki activity.  The deployment pipeline.  Ticket
  activity reports.  All these services were pretty much effortlessly
  set up to provide useful, real-time status information broadcast to
  topic-specific channels users could idle in.  Everyone could stay
  informed on topics of their interest, in real time, with no barrier
  to entry.  It was really good, and the implementation completed in a
  few hours total, for all use-cases, due to IRC's incredible
  simplicity.
</p>
<p>
  Due to the benefits I had reaped from that setup before, I tried to
  implement parts of it on/for the MS Teams platform at the then-new
  job.  Getting the Teams Python SDK to implement a bot-like entity
  running alone proved to be a days-long ordeal, and whatever followed
  wasn't much more pleasant.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, we let someone set up two
  email-to-teams-channel-forwards which kinda worked, but suffered
  from obnoxious, multi-minute relay delays.
</p>
<p>
  As a consequence of the tedious bringup and the latency shortcoming,
  the "effortless notification" initiative never really got traction.
</p>
<p>
  Not only because of this particular experience I am a firm believer
  that software/system simplicity is a virtue that can neither be
  overstated in importance, nor substituted by anything else.

  In the beginning was the command line.  Then the work of the bright
  people of Xerox PARC was used to hide from users the reality that
  lied underneath their beloved GUI: computers are just passing around
  strings of text.  Now we yearn for a time when we are just one
  <code>INT</code> and several <code>MOV</code> away from putting a
  pixel on a screen, instead of downloading a multi-GB IDE to fiddle
  for a weekend before we can show a simple window.

  Speaking of simplicity, this blog has a fantastic design.  The CSS
  is only ~30 lines and is largely just applying spacing/padding.  No
  JS, no custom font, etc.

  I'd say it's in the same general box as the simplicity of 8-bit
  computers booting into Basic interpreter, and the simplicity of
  Legos.
</p>
<p>
  It's wonderful when you can have your toys in a sandbox where you
  use and develop them mostly for fun, and for scratching your own
  itch, away from well-moneyed interests.  No need to carefully
  identify participants.  No need to encrypt, or otherwise complicate
  the implementation.  No need to efficiently serve millions of users.
  No need to add bling to attract more of those who barely cares.
  (The latter is not the case with Legos lately, though.)
</p>
<p>
  This is why I think that a lot of innovation starts in the fringe,
  and looks like mostly useless toys, until one of these toys proves
  very useful for &quot;real world&quot; needs.

  As an aside, can I just say how refreshing this website is?  It's
  100% content, just text.  Now view the HTML source, and be amazed.
  I daresay the author actually wrote the HTML by hand.  I suppose it
  could be a very conservative and conscientious site generator that
  even respects line length, but I'd be surprised.  Short CSS file for
  minimal style tweaks, and readable markup.  Fitting that the article
  is about simplicity.  When I first learned html (late 90s) this is
  what it looked like.  Very nice.

  Usenet too.  Getting news and discuss stuff "offline" and
  fetching/sending the messages once a week it's magical and resting.

  I used IRC for gaming around 2004 - fond memories!
</p>
<p>
  I recently tried Discord to find programming communities but I just
  don't get it.  When you join a server you are automatically
  subscribed to all the channels.  And apparently you can't leave
  them, you can only 'silence' them by manually doing that for each
  channel.  After a few days I just gave up as I could not keep up
  with all the notifications.

  I find Matrix a fine substitute for IRC.  Very simple to write
  clients and bots for.  And you get modern features IRC either lack
  or does not do well.

  I never used IRC growing up, to my knowledge, though I'm sure I used
  it by proxy in software that used it under the hood.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, I grew up with AOL Instant Messenger, and then MSN
  Messenger which later became Windows Live Messenger, then Skype,
  Xfire, Pidgin and Trillian as clients, then back to Skype again, and
  now Discord, which is where I still reside most of the time today.
</p>
<p>
  When I thought about existing chat protocols I wanted to use in game
  engines and websites that would allow one to connect through
  existing clients without having to join the game or navigate to the
  website in question directly, I thought about IRC.
</p>
<p>
  But it seems like people use Matrix now, and it just hasn't caught
  on to my circle of friends.  If I'm not mistaken, it almost seems
  like FOSS Discord.
</p>
<p>
  I was recently introduced to it by a member of a community of very
  friendly Quake Mappers.  I wonder if there is primarily first a
  cultural barrier to these technologies and not a technical one.  As
  usually I find more technical people on IRC than on Discord.

  I've never really played around with IRC, but I've definitely had
  the experience the author talks about with Matrix.  The server (like
  mentioned about IRC) is complicated, but interfacing with it as a
  user or a bot is mostly a few REST endpoints.  I've started using
  Matrix as my go-to interface for new projects.  You get I/O for
  free, plus authentication, user accounts, and multi-device; leaving
  just the fun stuff.

  Yeti,

  You don't understand what happened at Xerox PARC or what their "GUI"
  was.  Smalltalk wasn't a language.  It wasn't a GUI.  It was an
  <em>environment</em>.  Its whole point was that it didn't hide
  anything!  It was a completely different paradigm to how computers
  and their programs are architected today.  A Smalltalk system was
  always meant to be so simple that one could understand, and change,
  everything about it.

  Everyone should write an IRC client as an exercise in network
  programming due to its simplicity.  The other IM protocol for which
  I've written a client is early MSNP, which is also text-based and
  not immensely more complicated than IRC.  IMHO all the newer
  web-based stuff is a horrible mess of abstraction bloat.  TCP, and
  TLS if you want encryption, should be a sufficient base to build
  upon.

  I use Matrix and bridge in IRC, and third-party platforms whenever

  In addition to <code>ALIS</code>, there is also a web search for
  finding channels and their
  servers: <a href="https://netsplit.de/channels/">https://netsplit.de/channels/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To find new channels, I also found it helpful to aggregate the lists
  of all channel participants with an Irssi script
  named <code>jalso.pl</code> from
