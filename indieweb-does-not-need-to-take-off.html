<h1>The IndieWeb Doesn't Need to 'Take Off'</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 22 Feb 2025</div>
<p>
  There's a corner of the Internet where people have been reclaiming
  their digital independence by hosting their own websites and
  promoting the idea of owning your own content.  It's called the
  IndieWeb.  This community has its own
  <a href="https://indieweb.org/">website</a>, IRC channels, social
  media presence, etc., all dedicated to the idea that individuals
  should control their own digital presence through personal websites.
</p>
<p>
  Publishing your own website isn't a new concept.  It is the very
  essence of the Web!  This is what the Web has always been about
  since its early days.  But in an era where corporate-controlled
  platforms dominate online interaction, the IndieWeb emphasises the
  original spirit of the Web, where individuals have control over
  their content, identities and online spaces.  Every time this topic
  arises in online discussions, someone inevitably claims that the
  IndieWeb hasn't taken off!
</p>
<p>
  I feel that such claims about the IndieWeb not 'taking off' are
  either stating the obvious or, if that's not the intention,
  completely missing the point.  It's like saying that gardening
  hasn't taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the
  supermarket.  The IndieWeb doesn't need to 'take off' to be valuable
  to those who participate in it.  Maintaining a personal website is
  about owning your digital presence, embracing creative freedom and
  expressing your individuality!  It's not about appealing to the
  masses!
</p>
<p>
  I remember how, in the early 2000s, I used to spend my spare time
  learning HTML and writing my website, one HTML tag at a time.
  Writing a few lines of code in a text editor and then watching the
  browser render that code into a vibrant web page full of colours and
  images felt like an art form.  It was doubly fun to find other
  netizens who shared that same joy of maintaining and publishing
  their websites.  The IndieWeb is about preserving that hacker
  culture where websites are crafted and hosted not for mass appeal
  but for the sheer joy of creation and sharing with like-minded
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  The IndieWeb doesn't need to go mainstream to be meaningful.  It's a
  celebration of a more personal, decentralised and creative world
  wide web.  For those of us who still care about these values, it is
  already meaningful.
