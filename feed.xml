<p>
  QuickQWERTY 1.2.0 is now available.  QuickQWERTY is a web-based
  touch typing tutor for QWERTY keyboards that runs directly in the
  web browser.
</p>
<p>
  This release brings small improvements to make the typing tutor
  smoother and the lessons more accurate.  When you return to the
  application, it no longer needlessly redirects you back to Unit 1.1
  if that was the last lesson you practised.
</p>
<p>
  Several lessons have received minor corrections.  Units 7.2 and 7.3
  no longer include the word "tyre", avoiding a preference for either
  British or American spelling.  Units 9.2 and 9.3 now spell
  "orwellian" correctly.  A factual error in Unit 17.4 has been fixed
  too.  It previously said "89 is one more than 99", which now
  correctly reads "89 is one more than 88".
</p>
<p>
  Finally, switching between the 5-6 and 6-7 split layouts is now more
  reliable.  In the previous release, pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> to
  cancel the confirmation dialogue still caused the switch to go
  through.  Now pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> properly cancels the switch as
  expected.
</p>

<title>I Reinstated My Guestbook After 20 Years</title>
<link>https://susam.net/reinstated-guestbook.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  I have reinstated the <a href="guestbook.html">guestbook</a> on this
  website after 20 years!  As I have written in the
  <a href="about.html">About</a> page, this website began its life as
  an intranet portal in my university network back in 2001â€“2005.  That
  portal first ran on Microsoft Personal Web Server (PWS) and later on
  Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), with the guestbook
  data stored in a Microsoft Access database.  At the same time, I
  also maintained a small public website on the Internet, hosted on a
  subdomain provided by a free hosting service, where I published a
  subset of the articles from the intranet portal.  Both the intranet
  portal and the public website had guestbooks.  The guestbook on the
  public website was powered by a CGI script provided by the hosting
  service, which inserted each comment directly into the guestbook
  HTML page.  As some of you might guess, yes, it was vulnerable to
  cross-site scripting, but that's beside the point.
</p>
<p>
  After leaving the university, I registered my own domain name and
  set up my current website on the World Wide Web and included some of
  the content from both the original intranet portal and the old
  public website.  For some reason, though, I never thought to include
  a guestbook.  And so this website went on without a guestbook for
  the next 20 years.  Finally, in June 2025, I decided to bring the
  guestbook back.  I already had a commenting system implemented for
  this website using Common Lisp and Hunchentoot, so I simply reused
  it for the guestbook.  The
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/0.3.0/form.lisp">server program</a>
  accepts POST requests to receive comments and writes them to text
  files on the web server for manual review.  The comments are then
  rendered as static HTML pages by my static site generator.  In a
  way, it is less a comment system and more a static comment pages
  generator.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I could not restore all the comments from the
  original guestbooks.  The ASP source code of my intranet portal as
  well as the guestbook database are now lost to time.  Note that what
  I refer to as ASP here is now known as Classic ASP, to avoid
  confusion with ASP.NET.  A CD-ROM backup eventually succumbed to
  disc rot and with it vanished the source code and the database.  But
  a handful of comments had survived because they had found their way
  into other files and correspondence and I have now included them
  here.  I had better luck with the guestbook of the old public
  website, from which I was able to recover a greater number of
  comments.  It is still only a small fraction of what once existed,
  but it feels good to have even those fragments preserved.  The new
  guestbook is now available here:
  <a href="guestbook.html">Guestbook</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I wasn't expecting anybody to notice the new guestbook.  It is only
  mentioned in the <a href="about.html">About</a> and
  <a href="links.html">Links</a> pages, neither of which see much
  traffic.  Here are a few examples:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I love that your website has a guestbook!  :D
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Love the guestbook!  We need more of these.  Makes you feel
    invited.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It's a small addition to my website, but after two decades, it feels
  good to see the guestbook alive again and even better to see
  visitors enjoying it!

<title>QuickQWERTY 1.1.0</title>
<link>https://susam.net/code/news/quickqwerty/1.1.0.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  There has been a new release of QuickQWERTY after over 10 years!
  QuickQWERTY is a web-based touch typing tutor for QWERTY keyboards
  that runs directly in the web browser.  You can try it out
  here: <a href="../../../quickqwerty.html">quickqwerty.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The new release, version 1.1.0 of QuickQWERTY, introduces a new
  input command named <code>reset</code>, which is a synoymn for the
  existing commands <code>restart</code> and <code>rst</code> used to
  restart the current lesson.  Another input command
  named <code>test</code> runs an internal suite of tests to validate
  that no lesson involves keys that have not been introduced in the
  current or prior lessons.  Further, in this release, the application
  has been fully rewritten as a single standalone HTML file with no
  external dependencies and the source code has been greatly
  simplified.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of other changes too.  Words per minute (WPM)
  calculation has been refined so the first character, which starts
  the timer, is not counted.  The guides have been enhanced.  Keys to
  be pressed are now highlighted more clearly and reminders to return
  fingers to their home positions have been added to each guide.  The
  confirmation dialogue for switching between 6-7 split and 5-6 split
  styles now uses the HTML <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element,
  replacing the dated <code>window.confirm()</code> prompt.  In
  addition, when the application is opened without a fragment
  identifier in the URL, the most recently practised lesson loads
  automatically.
</p>
<p>
  The user interface has been simplified.  The previous and next links
  (<code>&laquo;</code> and <code>&raquo;</code>) for navigating
  lessons have been removed, as they added little value and made the
  layout of the various user interface components more complex.  The
  "Next lesson" advice link remains for moving to the next lesson when
  the current one is completed successfully.  Tooltips showing
  additional typing metrics have also been removed due to limited
  usefulness.
</p>
<p>
  The lessons have been updated to remove spellings specific to
  American English.  Care has been taken to use only words that are
  spelled the same in American and British English with one exception.
  The word "tyre", in its British English spelling, was mistakenly
  left in the lesson.  That will be fixed in the next release.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, QuickQWERTY's license has changed from the BSD-2-Clause
  licence to the MIT licence.  The source code is available at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/quickqwerty">github.com/susam/quickqwerty</a>.

<p>
  I recently had an engaging conversation with Alex
  (<a href="https://lobste.rs/~veqq">@veqq</a>) from the
  <a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobsters</a> community about computing,
  mathematics and a range of related topics.  Our conversation was
  later published on the community website as
  <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/kltoas">Lobsters Interview with
  Susam</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I should mention the sections presented in that post are not in the
  same order in which we originally discussed them.  The sections were
  edited and rearranged by Alex to improve the flow and avoid
  repetition of similar topics too close to each other.
</p>
<p>
  This page preserves a copy of our discussion as edited by Alex, so I
  can keep an archived version on my website.  In my copy, I have
  added a table of contents to make it easier to navigate to specific
  sections.  The interview itself follows the table of contents.  I
  hope you enjoy reading it.

<!-- Lisp and other things -->
<p class="question" id="lisp-and-other-things">
  Hi <a href="https://lobste.rs/~susam">@susam</a>, I primarily know
  you as a Lisper, what other things do you use?
</p>
<p>
  Yes, I use Lisp extensively for my personal projects and much of
  what I do in my leisure is built on it.  I ran
  a <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">mathematics pastebin</a>
  for close to thirteen years.  It was quite popular on some IRC
  channels.  The pastebin was written in Common Lisp.
  My <a href="https://susam.net/">personal website</a> and blog are
  generated using a tiny static site generator written in Common Lisp.
  Over the years I have built several other personal tools in it as
  well.
</p>
<p>
  I am an active Emacs Lisp programmer too.  Many of my software tools
  are in fact Emacs Lisp functions that I invoke with convenient key
  sequences.  They help me automate repetitive tasks as well as
  improve my text editing and task management experience.
</p>
<p>
  I use plenty of other tools as well.  In my early adulthood, I spent
  many years working with C, C++, Java and PHP.  My
  <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-559">first
  substantial open source contribution</a> was to the Apache Nutch
  project which was in Java and one of my early original open source
  projects was <a href="https://github.com/susam/uncap">Uncap</a>, a C
  program to remap keys on Windows.
</p>
<p>
  These days I use a lot of Python, along with some Go and Rust, but
  Lisp remains important to my personal work.  I also enjoy writing
  small standalone tools directly in HTML and JavaScript, often with
  all the code in a single file in a readable, unminified form.
</p>
<!-- Lisp, Emacs and mathematics -->
<p class="question" id="lisp-emacs-and-mathematics">
  How did you first discover computing, then end up with Lisp, Emacs
  and mathematics?
</p>
<p>
  I got introduced to computers through the Logo programming language
  as a kid.  Using simple arithmetic, geometry, logic and code to
  manipulate a two-dimensional world had a lasting effect on me.
</p>
<p>
  I still vividly remember how I ended up with Lisp.  It was at an
  airport during a long layover in 2007.  I wanted to use the time to
  learn something, so I booted my laptop
  running <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> GNU/Linux 4.0
  (Etch) and then started
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/">GNU CLISP</a> 2.41.
  In those days, Wi-Fi in airports was uncommon.  Smartphones and
  mobile data were also uncommon.  So it was fortunate that I had
  CLISP already installed on my system and my laptop was ready for
  learning Common Lisp.  I had it installed because I had wanted to
  learn Common Lisp for some time.  I was especially attracted by its
  simplicity, by the fact that the entire language can be built up
  from a very small set of special forms.  I
  use <a href="https://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a> these days, by the way.
</p>
<p>
  I discovered Emacs through Common Lisp.  Several sources recommended
  using the <a href="https://slime.common-lisp.dev/">Superior Lisp
  Interaction Mode for Emacs (SLIME)</a> for Common Lisp programming,
  so that's where I began.  For many years I continued to use Vim as
  my primary editor, while relying on Emacs and SLIME for Lisp
  development.  Over time, as I learnt more about Emacs itself, I grew
  fond of Emacs Lisp and eventually made Emacs my primary editor and
  computing environment.
</p>
<p>
  I have loved mathematics since my childhood days.  What has always
  fascinated me is how we can prove deep and complex facts using first
  principles and clear logical steps.  That feeling of certainty and
  rigour is unlike anything else.
</p>
<p>
  Over the years, my love for the subject has been rekindled many
  times.  As a specific example, let me share how I got into number
  theory.  One day I decided to learn the RSA cryptosystem.  As I was
  working through the
  <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf">RSA
  paper</a>, I stumbled upon the Euler totient function
  \( \varphi(n) \) which gives the number of positive integers not
  exceeding n that are relatively prime to n.  The paper first states
  that

  \[
    \varphi(p) = p - 1
  \]

  for prime numbers \( p.  \)  That was obvious since \( p \) has no
  factors other than \( 1 \) and itself, so every integer from \( 1 \)
  up to \( p - 1 \) must be relatively prime to it.  But then it
  presents

  \[
    \varphi(pq) = \varphi(p) \cdot \varphi(q) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
  \]

  for primes \( p \) and \( q.  \)  That was not immediately obvious to
  me back then.  After a few minutes of thinking, I managed to prove
  it from scratch.  By the inclusion-exclusion principle, we count how
  many integers from \( 1 \) up to \( pq \) are not divisible by
  \(p \) or \( q.  \)  There are \( pq \) integers in total.  Among
  them, there are \( q \) integers divisible by \( p \) and \( p \)
  integers divisible by \( q.  \)  So we need to subtract \( p + q \)
  from \(pq.  \)  But since one integer (\( pq \) itself) is counted in
  both groups, we add \( 1 \) back.  Therefore

  \[
    \varphi(pq) = pq - (p + q) + 1 = (p - 1)(q - 1).
  \]

  Next I could also obtain the general formula for \( \varphi(n) \)
  for an arbitrary positive integer \( n \) using the same idea.
  There are several other proofs too, but that is how I derived the
  general formula for \( \varphi(n) \) when I first encountered it.
  And just like that, I had begun to learn number theory!
</p>
<!-- Computing for fun -->
<p class="question" id="computing-for-fun">
  You've said you prefer computing for fun.  What is fun to you?  Do
  you have an idea of what makes something fun or not?
</p>
<p>
  For me, fun in computing began when I first learnt IBM/LCSI PC Logo
  when I was nine years old.  I had very limited access to computers
  back then, perhaps only about two hours per <em>month</em> in the
  computer laboratory at my primary school.  Most of my Logo
  programming happened with pen and paper at home.  I would "test" my
  programs by tracing the results on graph paper.  Eventually I would
  get about thirty minutes of actual computer time in the lab to run
  them for real.
</p>
<p>
  So back then, most of my computing happened without an actual
  computer.  But even with that limited access to computers, a whole
  new world opened up for me: one that showed me the joy of computing
  and more importantly, the joy of sharing my little programs with my
  friends and teachers.  One particular Logo program I still remember
  very well drew a house with animated dashed lines, where the dashes
  moved around the outline of the house.  Everyone around me loved it,
  copied it and tweaked it to change the colours, alter the details
  and add their own little touches.
</p>
<p>
  For me, fun in computing comes from such exploration and sharing.  I
  enjoy asking "what happens if" and then seeing where it leads me.
  My Emacs package
  <a href="https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/devil.html">devil-mode</a>
  comes from such exploration.  It came from asking, "What happens if
  we avoid using the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>meta</kbd> modifier keys
  and use <kbd>,</kbd> (the comma key) or another suitable key as a
  leader key instead?  And can we still have a non-modal editing
  experience?"
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes computing for fun may mean crafting a minimal esoteric
  drawing language, making a small game or building a tool that solves
  an interesting problem elegantly.  It is a bonus if the exploration
  results in something working well enough that I can share with
  others on the World Wide Web and others find it fun too.
</p>
<!-- Pursuits -->
<p class="question" id="interests-and-exploration">
  How do you choose what to investigate?  Which most interest you,
  with what commonalities?
</p>
<p>
  For me, it has always been one exploration leading to another.
</p>
<p>
  For example, I originally built
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">MathB</a> for my friends
  and myself who were going through a phase in our lives when we used
  to challenge each other with mathematical puzzles.  This tool became
  a nice way to share solutions with each other.  Its use spread from
  my friends to their friends and colleagues, then to schools and
  universities and eventually to IRC channels.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, I built <a href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a>
  when I was learning neural networks and taking a lot of notes on the
  subject.  I was not ready to share the notes online, but I did want
  to share them with my friends and colleagues who were also learning
  the same topic.  Normally I would write my notes in LaTeX, compile
  them to PDF and share the PDF, but in this case, I wondered, what if
  I took some of the code from MathB and created a tool that would let
  me write plain Markdown
  (<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GFM</a>) + LaTeX
  (<a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>) in
  a <code>.html</code> file and have the tool render the file as soon
  as it was opened in a web browser?  That resulted in TeXMe, which
  has surprisingly become one of my most popular projects, receiving
  millions of hits in some months according to the CDN statistics.
</p>
<p>
  Another example is <a href="https://susam.github.io/muboard/">Muboard</a>,
  which is a bit like an interactive mathematics chalkboard.  I built
  this when I was hosting an
  <a href="journey-to-prime-number-theorem.html">analytic number
  theory book club</a> and I needed a way to type LaTeX snippets live
  on screen and see them immediately rendered.  That made me wonder:
  what if I took TeXMe, made it interactive and gave it a chalkboard
  look-and-feel?  That led to Muboard.
</p>
<p>
  So we can see that sharing mathematical notes and snippets has been
  a recurring theme in several of my projects.  But that is only a
  small fraction of my interests.  I have a wide variety of interests
  in computing.  I also engage in random explorations, like writing
  IRC clients
  (<a href="https://github.com/susam/nimb">NIMB</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/tzero">Tzero</a>),
  ray tracing
  (<a href="https://github.com/susam/pov25">POV-Ray</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/spxy/java-ray-tracing">Java ray tracer</a>),
  writing Emacs guides
  (<a href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/emfy">Emfy</a>),
  developing small single-file HTML games
  (<a href="invaders.html">Andromeda Invaders</a>,
  <a href="myrgb.html">Guess My RGB</a>),
  purely recreational programming
  (<a href="fxyt.html">FXYT</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/may4">may4.fs</a>,
  <a href="self-printing-machine-code.html">self-printing machine code</a>,
  <a href="primegrid.html">prime number grid explorer</a>)
  and so on.  The list goes on.  When it comes to hobby computing, I
  don't think I can pick just one domain and say it interests me the
  most.  I have a lot of interests.
</p>
<!-- What is computing?  -->
<p class="question" id="computing-activities">
  What is computing, to you?
</p>
<p>
  Computing, to me, covers a wide range of activities: programming a
  computer, using a computer, understanding how it works, even
  building one.  For example, I once built a tiny 16-bit CPU along
  with a small main memory that could hold only eight 16-bit
  instructions, using VHDL and a Xilinx CPLD kit.  The design was
  based on the Mano CPU introduced in the book <em>Computer System
  Architecture</em> (3rd ed.) by M. Morris Mano.  It was incredibly
  fun to enter instructions into the main memory, one at a time, by
  pushing DIP switches up and down and then watch the CPU I had built
  execute an entire program.  For someone like me, who usually works
  with software at higher levels of abstraction, that was a thrilling
  experience!
</p>
<p>
  Beyond such experiments, computing also includes more practical and
  concrete activities, such as installing and using my favourite Linux
  distribution (Debian), writing software tools in languages like
  Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, Python and the shell command language or
  customising my Emacs environment to automate repetitive tasks.
</p>
<p>
  To me, computing also includes the abstract stuff like spending time
  with abstract algebra and number theory and getting a deeper
  understanding of the results pertaining to groups, rings and fields,
  as well as numerous number-theoretic results.  Browsing the
  <a href="https://oeis.org/">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer
  Sequences</a> (OEIS), writing small programs to explore interesting
  sequences or just thinking about them is computing too.  I think
  many of the interesting results in computer science have deep
  mathematical foundations.  I believe much of computer science is
  really discrete mathematics in action.
</p>
<p>
  And if we dive all the way down from the CPU to the level of
  transistors, we encounter continuous mathematics as well, with
  non-linear voltage-current relationships and analogue behaviour that
  make digital computing possible.  It is fascinating how, as a
  relatively new species on this planet, we have managed to take sand
  and find a way to use continuous voltages and currents in electronic
  circuits built with silicon and convert them into the discrete
  operations of digital logic.  We have machines that can simulate
  themselves!
</p>
<p>
  To me, all of this is fun.  To study and learn about these things,
  to think about them, to understand them better and to accomplish
  useful or amusing results with this knowledge is all part of the
  fun.
</p>
<!-- Programming vs domains -->
<p class="question" id="programming-vs-domains">
  How do you view programming vs. domains?
</p>
<p>
  I focus more on the domain than the tool.  Most of the time it is a
  problem that catches my attention and then I explore it to
  understand the domain and arrive at a solution.  The problem itself
  usually points me to one of the tools I already know.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if it is about working with text files, I might write
  an Emacs Lisp function.  If it involves checking large sets of
  numbers rapidly for patterns, I might choose C++ or Rust.  But if I
  want to share interactive visualisations of those patterns with
  others, I might rewrite the solution in HTML and JavaScript,
  possibly with the use of the Canvas API, so that I can share the
  work as a self-contained file that others can execute easily within
  their web browsers.  When I do that, I prefer to keep the HTML neat
  and readable, rather than bundled or minified, so that people who
  like to 'View Source' can copy, edit and customise the code
  themselves to immediately see their changes take effect.
</p>
<p>
  Let me share a specific example.  While working on a web-based game, I first
  used <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code>'s <code>fillText()</code>
  to display text on the game canvas.  However, dissatisfied with the
  text rendering quality, I began looking for IBM PC OEM fonts and
  similar retro fonts online.  After downloading a few font packs, I
  wrote a little Python script to convert them to bitmaps (arrays of
  integers) and then used the bitmaps to draw text on the canvas using
  JavaScript, one cell at a time, to get pixel-perfect results!  These
  tiny Python and JavaScript tools were good enough that I felt
  comfortable sharing them together as a tiny toolkit called
  <a href="https://susam.github.io/pcface/src/demo.html">PCFace</a>.
  This toolkit offers JavaScript bitmap arrays and tiny JavaScript
  rendering functions, so that someone else who wants to display text
  on their game canvas using PC fonts and nothing but plain HTML and
  JavaScript can do so without having to solve the problem from
  scratch!
</p>
<!-- Applicability of old functionality for new problems -->
<p class="question" id="old-functionality-and-new-problems">
  Has the rate of your making new Emacs functions has diminished over
  time (as if everything's covered) or do the widening domains lead to
  more?  I'm curious how applicable old functionality is for new
  problems and how that impacts the APIs!
</p>
<p>
  My rate of making new Emacs functions has definitely decreased.
  There are two reasons.  One is that over the years my computing
  environment has converged into a comfortable, stable setup I am very
  happy with.  The other is that at this stage of life I simply cannot
  afford the time to endlessly tinker with Emacs as I did in my
  younger days.
</p>
<p>
  More generally, when it comes to APIs, I find that well-designed
  functionality tends to remain useful even when new problems appear.
  In Emacs, for example, many of my older functions continue to serve
  me well because they were written in a composable way.  New problems
  can often be solved with small wrappers or combinations of existing
  functions.  I think APIs that consist of functions that are simple,
  orthogonal and flexible age well.  If each function in an API does
  one thing and does it well (the Unix philosophy), it will have
  long-lasting utility.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, new domains and problems do require new functions and
  extensions to an API, but I think it is very important to not give
  in to the temptation of enhancing the existing functions by making
  them more complicated with optional parameters, keyword arguments,
  nested branches and so on.  Personally, I have found that it is much
  better to implement new functions that are small, orthogonal and
  flexible, each doing one thing and doing it well.
</p>
<p class="question" id="designing-for-composability">
  What design methods or tips do you have, to increase composability?
</p>
<p>
  For me, good design starts with good vocabulary.  Clear vocabulary
  makes abstract notions concrete and gives collaborators a shared
  language to work with.  For example, while working on a network
  events database many years ago, we collected data minute by minute
  from network devices.  We decided to call each minute of data from a
  single device a "nugget".  So if we had 15 minutes of data from 10
  devices, that meant 150 nuggets.
</p>
<p>
  Why "nugget"?  Because it was shorter and more convenient than
  repeatedly saying "a minute of data from one device".  Why not
  something less fancy like "chunk"?  Because we reserved "chunk" for
  subdivisions within a nugget.  Perhaps there were better choices,
  but "nugget" was the term we settled on and it quickly became shared
  terminology between the collaborators.  Good terminology naturally
  carries over into code.  With this vocabulary in place, function
  names like <code>collect_nugget()</code>,
  <code>open_nugget()</code>, <code>parse_chunk()</code>,
  <code>index_chunk()</code>, <code>skip_chunk()</code>,
  etc. immediately become meaningful to everyone involved.
</p>
<p>
  Thinking about the vocabulary also ensures that we are thinking
  about the data, concepts and notions we are working with in a
  deliberate manner and that kind of thinking also helps when we
  design the architecture of software.
</p>
<p>
  Too often I see collaborators on software projects jump straight
  into writing functions that take some input and produce some desired
  effect, with variable names and function names decided on the fly.
  To me, this feels backwards.  I prefer the opposite approach.
  Define the terms first and let the code follow from them.
</p>
<p>
  I also prefer developing software in a layered manner, where complex
  functionality is built from simpler, well-named building blocks.  It
  is especially important to avoid <em>layer violations</em>, where
  one complex function invokes another complex function.  That creates
  tight coupling between two complex functions.  If one function
  changes in the future, we have to reason carefully about how it
  affects the other.  Since both are already complex, the cognitive
  burden is high.  A better approach, I think, is to identify the
  common functionality they share and factor that out into smaller,
  simpler functions.
</p>
<p>
  To summarise, I like to develop software with a clear vocabulary,
  consistent use of that vocabulary, a layered design where complex
  functions are built from simpler ones and by avoiding layer
  violations.  I am sure none of this is new to the Lobsters
  community.  Some of these ideas also occur
  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">domain-driven
  design</a> (DDD).  DDD defines the term <em>ubiquitous language</em>
  to mean, "A language structured around the domain model and used by
  all team members within a bounded context to connect all the
  activities of the team with the software."  If I could call this
  approach of software development something, I would simply call it
  "vocabulary-driven development" (VDD), though of course DDD is the
  more comprehensive concept.
</p>
<p>
  Like I said, none of this is likely new to the Lobsters community.
  In particular, I suspect Forth programmers would find it too
  obvious.  In Forth, it is very difficult to begin with a long,
  poorly thought-out monolithic word and then break it down into
  smaller ones later.  The stack effects quickly become too hard to
  track mentally with that approach.  The only viable way to develop
  software in Forth is to start with a small set of words that
  represent the important notions of the problem domain, test them
  immediately and then compose higher-level words from the lower-level
  ones.  Forth naturally encourages a layered style of development,
  where the programmer thinks carefully about the domain, invents
  vocabulary and expresses complex ideas in terms of simpler ones,
  almost in a mathematical fashion.  In my experience, this kind of
  deliberate design produces software that remains easy to understand
  and reason about even years after it was written.
</p>
<!-- Small vs large functions -->
<p class="question" id="small-vs-large-functions">
  Not enhancing existing functions but adding new small ones seems
  quite lovely, but how do you come back to such a codebase later with
  many tiny functions?  At points, I've advocated for very large
  functions, particularly traumatized by Java-esque 1000 functions in
  1000 files approaches.  When you had time, would you often
  rearchitecture the conceptual space of all of those functions?
</p>
<p>
  The famous quote from Alan J. Perlis comes to mind:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure
    than 10 functions on 10 data structures.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Personally, I enjoy working with a codebase that has thousands of
  functions, provided most of them are small, well-scoped and do one
  thing well.  That said, I am not dogmatically opposed to large
  functions.  It is always a matter of taste and judgement.  Sometimes
  one large, cohesive function is clearer than a pile of tiny ones.
</p>
<p>
  For example, when I worked on parser generators, I often found that
  lexers and finite state machines benefited from a single top-level
  function containing the full tokenisation logic or the full state
  transition logic in one place.  That function could call smaller
  helpers for specific tasks, but we still need the overall
  <code>switch</code>-<code>case</code> or
  <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> or <code>cond</code> ladder
  somewhere.  I think trying to split that ladder into smaller
  functions would only make the code harder to follow.
</p>
<p>
  So while I lean towards small, composable functions, the real goal
  is to strike a balance that keeps code maintainable in the long run.
  Each function should be as small as it can reasonably be and no
  smaller.
</p>
<!-- Domains -->
<p class="question" id="domains-and-projects">
  Like you, I program as a tool to explore domains.  Which do you know
  the most about?
</p>
<p>
  For me too, the appeal of computer programming lies especially in
  how it lets me explore different domains.  There are two kinds of
  domains in which I think I have gained good expertise.  The first
  comes from years of developing software for businesses, which has
  included solving problems such as network events parsing, indexing
  and querying, packet decoding, developing parser generators,
  database session management and TLS certificate lifecycle
  management.  The second comes from areas I pursue purely out of
  curiosity or for hobby computing.  This is the kind I am going to
  focus on in our conversation.
</p>
<p>
  Although computing and software are serious business today, for me,
  as for many others, computing is also a hobby.
</p>
<p>
  Personal hobby projects often lead me down various rabbit holes and
  I end up learning new domains along the way.  For example, although
  I am not a web developer, I learnt to build small, interactive
  single-page tools in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript simply because I
  needed them for my hobby projects over and over again.  An early
  example is <a href="quickqwerty.html">QuickQWERTY</a>, which I built
  to teach myself and my friends touch-typing on QWERTY keyboards.
  Another example is <a href="cfrs.html">CFRS[]</a>, which I created
  because I wanted to make a total (non-Turing complete) drawing
  language that has turtle graphics like Logo but is absolutely
  minimal like P&prime;&prime;.
</p>
<!-- Double spacing -->
<p class="question" id="double-spacing-and-touch-typing">
  You use double spaces after periods which I'd only experienced from
  people who learned touch typing on typewriters, unexpected!
</p>
<p>
  Yes, I do separate sentences by double spaces.  It is interesting
  that you noticed this.
</p>
<p>
  I once briefly learnt touch typing on typewriters as a kid, but
  those lessons did not stick with me.  It was much later, when I used
  a Java applet-based touch typing tutor that I found online about two
  decades ago, that the lessons really stayed with me.  Surprisingly,
  that application taught me to type with a single space between
  sentences.  By the way, I disliked installing Java plugins into the
  web browser, so I wrote <a href="quickqwerty.html">QuickQWERTY</a>
  as a similar touch typing tutor in plain HTML and JavaScript for
  myself and my friends.
</p>
<p>
  I learnt to use double spaces between sentences first with Vim and
  then later again with Emacs.  For example, in Vim,
  the <code>joinspaces</code> option is on by default, so when we join
  sentences with the normal mode command <code>J</code> or format
  paragraphs with <code>gqap</code>, Vim inserts two spaces after full
  stops.  We need to disable that behaviour with <code>:set
  nojoinspaces</code> if we want single spacing.
</p>
<p>
  It is similar in Emacs.  In Emacs, the
  <code>delete-indentation</code> command (<code>M-^</code>) and
  the <code>fill-paragraph</code> command (<code>M-q</code>) both
  insert two spaces between sentences by default.  Single spacing can
  be enabled with <code>(setq sentence-end-double-space nil)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Incidentally, I spend a good portion of the README for my Emacs
  quick-start DIY kit named
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/emfy">Emfy</a> discussing sentence
  spacing conventions under the section
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/emfy#single-space-for-sentence-spacing">Single
  Space for Sentence Spacing</a>.  There I explain how to configure
  Emacs to use single spaces, although I use double spaces myself.
  That's because many new Emacs users prefer single spacing.
</p>
<p>
  The defaults in Vim and Emacs made me adopt double spacing.  The
  double spacing convention is also widespread across open source
  software.  If we look at the Vim help pages, Emacs built-in
  documentation or the Unix and Linux man pages, double spacing is the
  norm.  Even inline comments in traditional open source projects
  often use it.  For example, see Vim's
  <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/v9.1.1752/runtime/doc/usr_01.txt">:h usr_01.txt</a>,
  Emacs's
  <a href="https://cgit.git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/doc/emacs/emacs.texi?h=emacs-30.2#n1556">(info "(emacs) Intro")</a>
  or the comments in the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;f=gcc/cfg.cc;hb=releases/gcc-15.2.0">GCC source code</a>.
</p>
<!-- Learning -->
<p class="question" id="approach-to-learning">
  How do you approach learning a new domain?
</p>
<p>
  When I take on a new domain, there is of course a lot of reading
  involved from articles, books and documentation.  But as I read, I
  constantly try to test what I learn.  Whenever I see a claim, I ask
  myself, "If this claim were wrong, how could I demonstrate it?"
  Then I design a little experiment, perhaps write a snippet of code
  or run a command or work through a concrete example, with the goal
  of checking the claim in practice.
</p>
<p>
  Now I am not genuinely hoping to prove a claim wrong.  It is just a
  way to engage with the material.  To illustrate, let me share an
  extremely simple and generic example without going into any
  particular domain.  Suppose I learn that Boolean operations in
  Python short-circuit.  I might write out several experimental
  snippets like the following:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def t(): print('t'); return True
def f(): print('f'); return False
f() or t() or f()
</code></pre>
<p>
  And then confirm that the results do indeed confirm short-circuit
  evaluation (<code>f</code> followed by <code>t</code> in this case).
</p>
<p>
  At this point, one could say, "Well, you just confirmed what the
  documentation already told you."  And that's true.  But for me, the
  value lies in trying to test it for myself.  Even if the claim
  holds, the act of checking forces me to see the idea in action.
  That not only reinforces the concept but also helps me build a much
  deeper intuition for it.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes these experiments also expose gaps in my own
  understanding.  Suppose I didn't properly know what "short-circuit"
  means.  Then the results might contradict my expectations.  That
  contradiction would push me to correct my misconception and that's
  where the real learning happens.
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally, this process even uncovers subtleties I didn't expect.
  For example, while learning socket programming, I discovered that a
  client can successfully receive data using <code>recv()</code> even
  after calling <code>shutdown()</code>, contrary to what I had first
  inferred from the specifications.  See my Stack Overflow post
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/39698037/303363">Why can recv()
  receive messages after the client has invoked shutdown()?</a> for
  more details if you are curious.
</p>
<p>
  Now this method cannot always be applied, especially if it is very
  expensive or unwieldy to do so.  For example, if I am learning
  something in the finance domain, it is not always possible to
  perform an actual transaction.  One can sometimes use simulation
  software, mock environments or sandbox systems to explore ideas
  safely.  Still, it is worth noting that this method has its
  limitations.
</p>
<p>
  In mathematics, though, I find this method highly effective.  When I
  study a new branch of mathematics, I try to come up with examples
  and counterexamples to test what I am learning.  Often, failing to
  find a counterexample helps me appreciate more deeply why a claim
  holds and why no counterexamples exist.
</p>
<!-- Distraction -->
<p class="question" id="managing-time-and-distractions">
  Do you have trouble not getting distracted with so much on your
  plate?  I'm curious how you balance the time commitments of
  everything!
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, it is very easy to get distracted.  One thing that has
  helped over the years is the increase in responsibilities in other
  areas of my life.  These days I also spend some of my free time
  studying mathematics textbooks.  With growing responsibilities and
  the time I devote to mathematics, I now get at most a few hours each
  week for hobby computing.  This automatically narrows down my
  options.  I can explore perhaps one or at most two ideas in a month
  and that constraint makes me very deliberate about choosing my
  pursuits.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the explorations do not evolve into something solid that I
  can share.  They remain as little experimental code snippets or
  notes archived in a private repository.  But once in a while, an
  exploration grows into something concrete and feels worth sharing on
  the Web.  That becomes a short-term hobby project.  I might work on
  it over a weekend if it is small or for a few weeks if it is more
  complex.  When that happens, the goal of sharing the project helps
  me focus.
</p>
<p>
  I try not to worry too much about making time.  After all, this is
  just a hobby.  Other areas of my life have higher priority.  I also
  want to devote a good portion of my free time to learning more
  mathematics, which is another hobby I am passionate about.  Whatever
  little spare time remains after attending to the higher-priority
  aspects of my life goes into my computing projects, usually a couple
  of hours a week, most of it on weekends.
</p>
<!-- Blogging -->
<p class="question" id="blogging">
  How does blogging mix in?  What's the development like of a single
  piece of curiosity through wrestling with the domain, learning and
  sharing it etc.?
</p>
<p>
  Maintaining my personal website is another aspect of computing that
  I find very enjoyable.  My website began as a loose collection of
  pages on a LAN site during my university days.  Since then I have
  been adding pages to it to write about various topics that I find
  interesting.  It acquired its blog shape and form much later when
  blogging became fashionable.
</p>
<p>
  I usually write a new blog post when I feel like there is some piece
  of knowledge or some exploration that I want to archive in a
  persistent format.  Now what the development of a post looks like
  depends very much on the post.  So let me share two opposite
  examples to describe what the development of a single piece looks
  like.
</p>
<p>
  One of my most frequently visited posts
  is <a href="lisp-in-vim.html">Lisp in Vim</a>.  It started when I
  was hosting a Common Lisp programming club for beginners.  Although
  I have always used Emacs and SLIME for Common Lisp programming
  myself, many in the club used Vim, so I decided to write a short
  guide on setting up something SLIME-like there.  As a former
  long-time Vim user myself, I wanted to make the Lisp journey easier
  for Vim users too.  I thought it would be a 30-minute exercise where
  I write up a README that explains how to install
  <a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv">Slimv</a> and how to set
  it up in Vim.  But then I discovered a newer plugin called
  <a href="https://github.com/vlime/vlime">Vlime</a> that also offered
  SLIME-like features in Vim!  That detail sent me down a very deep
  rabbit hole.  Now I needed to know how the two packages were
  different, what their strengths and weaknesses were, how routine
  operations were performed in both and so on.  What was meant to be a
  short note turned into a nearly 10,000-word article.  As I was
  comparing the two SLIME-like packages for Vim, I also found a few
  bugs in Slimv and contributed fixes for them
  (<a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv/pull/87">#87</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv/pull/88">#88</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv/pull/89">#89</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv/pull/90">#90</a>).
  Writing this blog post turned into a month-long project!
</p>
<p>
  At the opposite extreme is a post like
  <a href="elliptical-python-programming.html">Elliptical
  Python Programming</a>.  I stumbled upon Python's
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis">Ellipsis</a>
  while reviewing someone's code.  It immediately caught my attention.
  I wondered if, combined with some standard obfuscation techniques,
  one could write arbitrary Python programs that looked almost like
  Morse code.  A few minutes of experimentation showed that a
  genuinely Morse code-like appearance was not possible, but something
  close could be achieved.  So I wrote what I hope is a humorous post
  demonstrating that arbitrary Python programs can be written using a
  very restricted set of symbols, one of which is the ellipsis.  It
  took me less than an hour to write this post.  The final result
  doesn't look quite like Morse code as I had imagined, but it is
  quite amusing nevertheless!
</p>
<!-- Forums -->
<p class="question" id="forums">
  What draws you to post and read online forums?  How do you balance
  or allot time for reading technical articles, blogs etc.?

<p>
  The exchange of ideas!  Just as I enjoy sharing my own
  computing-related thoughts, ideas and projects, I also find joy in
  reading what others have to share.
</p>
<p>
  Other areas of my life take precedence over hobby projects and hobby
  projects take precedence over technical forums.

  After I've given time to the higher-priority parts of my life and to

<!-- MathB.in -->
<p class="question" id="mathb-moderation-problems">
  When you decided to stop with MathB due to moderation burdens, I
  offered to take over/help and you mentioned others had too.  Did
  anyone end up forking it, to your knowledge?
</p>
<p>
  I first thought of shutting down the
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mathb">MathB</a>-based pastebin
  website in November 2019.  The website had been running for seven
  years at that time.  When I announced my thoughts to the IRC
  communities that would be affected, I received a lot of support and
  encouragement.  A few members even volunteered to help me out with
  moderation.  That support and encouragement kept me going for
  another six years.  However, the volunteers eventually became busy
  with their own lives and moved on.  After all, moderating user
  content for an open pastebin that anyone in the world can post to is
  a thankless and tiring activity.  So most of the moderation activity
  fell back on me.  Finally, in February 2025, I realised that I no
  longer want to spend time on this kind of work.
</p>
<p>
  I developed MathB with a lot of passion for myself and my friends.
  I had no idea at the time that this little project would keep a
  corner of my mind occupied even during weekends and holidays.  There
  was always a nagging worry.  What if someone posted content that
  triggered compliance concerns and my server was taken offline while
  I was away?  I no longer wanted that kind of burden in my life.  So
  I finally decided to shut it down.  I've written more about this
  in <a href="mathbin-is-shutting-down.html">MathB.in Is Shutting
  Down</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To my knowledge, no one has forked it, but others have developed

</p>
<!-- Textbooks -->
<p class="question" id="favourite-mathematics-textbooks">
  What're your favorite math textbooks?
</p>
<p>
  I have several favourite mathematics books, but let me share three I
  remember especially fondly.
</p>
<p>
  The first is <em>Advanced Engineering Mathematics</em> by Erwin
  Kreyszig.  I don't often see this book recommended online, but for
  me it played a major role in broadening my horizons.  I think I
  studied the 8th edition back in the early 2000s.  It is a hefty book
  with over a thousand pages and I remember reading it cover to cover,
  solving every exercise problem along the way.  It gave me a solid
  foundation in routine areas like differential equations, linear
  algebra, vector calculus and complex analysis.  It also introduced
  me to Fourier transforms and Laplace transforms, which I found
  fascinating.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, the Fourier transform has a wide range of applications in
  signal processing, communications, spectroscopy and more.  But I
  want to focus on the fun and playful part.  In the early 2000s, I
  was also learning to play the piano as a hobby.  I used to record my
  amateur music compositions with
  <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity">Audacity</a> by
  connecting my digital piano to my laptop with a line-in cable.  It
  was great fun to plot the spectrum of my music on Audacity, apply
  high-pass and low-pass filters and observe how the Fourier transform
  of the audio changed and then hear the effect on the music.  That
  kind of hands-on tinkering made Fourier analysis intuitive for me
  and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys both music and
  mathematics.
</p>
<p>
  The second book is <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>
  by Tom M.  Apostol.  As a child I was intrigued by the prime number
  theorem but lacked the mathematical maturity to understand its
  proof.  Years later, as an adult, I finally taught myself the proof
  from Apostol's book.  It was a fantastic journey that began with
  simple concepts like the MÃ¶bius function and Dirichlet products and
  ended with quite clever contour integrals that proved the theorem.
  The complex analysis I had learnt from Kreyszig turned out to be
  crucial for understanding those integrals.  Along the way I gained a
  deeper understanding of the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s).  \)
  The book discusses zero-free regions where \( \zeta(s) \) does not
  vanish, which I found especially fascinating.  Results like \(
  \zeta(-1) = -1/12, \) which once seemed mysterious, became obvious
  after studying this book.
</p>
<p>
  The third is <em>Galois Theory</em> by Ian Stewart.  It introduced
  me to field extensions, field homomorphisms and solubility by
  radicals.  I had long known that not all quintic equations are
  soluble by radicals, but I didn't know why.  Stewart's book taught
  me exactly why.  In particular, it demonstrated that the polynomial
  \( t^5 - 6t + 3 \) over the field of rational numbers is not soluble
  by radicals.  This particular result, although fascinating, is just
  a small part of a much larger body of work, which is even more
  remarkable.  To arrive at this result, the book takes us through a
  wonderful journey that includes the theory of polynomial rings,
  algebraic and transcendental field extensions, impossibility proofs
  for ruler-and-compass constructions, the Galois correspondence and
  much more.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most rewarding aspects of reading books like these is how
  they open doors to new knowledge, including things I didn't even
  know that I didn't know.
</p>
<!-- Mathematics and computing -->
<p class="question" id="mathematics-and-computing">
  How does the newer math jell with or inform past or present
  computing, compared to much older stuff?
</p>
<p>
  I don't always think explicitly about how mathematics informs
  computing, past or present.  Often the textbooks I pick feel very
  challenging to me, so much so that all my energy goes into simply
  mastering the material.  It is arduous but enjoyable.  I do it
  purely for the fun of learning without worrying about applications.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, a good portion of pure mathematics probably has no
  real-world applications.  As G. H. Hardy famously wrote in <em>A
  Mathematician's Apology</em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I have never done anything 'useful'.  No discovery of mine has
    made or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or
    ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  But there is no denying that some of it does find applications.
  Were Hardy alive today, he might be disappointed that number theory,
  his favourite field of "useless" mathematics, is now a crucial part
  of modern cryptography.  Electronic commerce wouldn't likely exist
  without it.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, it is amusing how something as abstract as abstract
  algebra finds very concrete applications in coding theory.  Concepts
  such as polynomial rings, finite fields and cosets of subspaces in
  vector spaces over finite fields play a crucial role in
  error-correcting codes, without which modern data transmission and
  storage would not be possible.
</p>
<p>
  On a more personal note, some simpler areas of mathematics have been
  directly useful in my own work.  While solving problems for
  businesses, information entropy, combinatorics and probability
  theory were crucial when I worked on gesture-based authentication
  about one and a half decades ago.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, when I was developing Bloom filter-based indexing and
  querying for a network events database, again, probability theory
  was crucial in determining the parameters of the Bloom filters (such
  as the number of hash functions, bits per filter and elements per
  filter) to ensure that the false positive rate remained below a
  certain threshold.  Subsequent testing with randomly sampled network
  events confirmed that the observed false positive rate matched the
  theoretical estimate quite well.  It was very satisfying to see
  probability theory and the real world agreeing so closely.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond these specific examples, studying mathematics also influences
  the way I think about problems.  Embarking on journeys like analytic
  number theory or Galois theory is humbling.  There are times when I
  struggle to understand a small paragraph of the book and it takes me
  several hours (or even days) to work out the arguments in detail
  with pen and paper (lots of it) before I really grok them.  That
  experience of grappling with dense reasoning teaches humility and
  also makes me sceptical of complex, hand-wavy logic in day-to-day
  programming.
</p>
<p>
  Several times I have seen code that bundles too many decisions into
  one block of logic, where it is not obvious whether it would behave
  correctly in all circumstances.  Explanations may sometimes be
  offered about why it works for reasonable inputs, but the reasoning
  is often not watertight.  The experience of working through
  mathematical proofs, writing my own, making mistakes and then
  correcting them has taught me that if the reasoning for correctness
  is not clear and rigorous, something could be wrong.  In my
  experience, once such code sees real-world usage, a bug is nearly
  always found.
</p>
<p>
  That's why I usually insist either on simplifying the logic or on
  demonstrating correctness in a clear, rigorous way.  Sometimes this
  means doing a case-by-case analysis for different types of inputs or
  conditions and showing that the code behaves correctly in each case.
  There is also a bit of an art to reducing what seem like numerous or
  even infinitely many cases to a small, manageable set of cases by
  spotting structure, such as symmetries, invariants or natural
  partitions of the input space.  Alternatively, one can look for a
  simpler argument that covers all cases.  These are techniques we
  employ routinely in mathematics and I think that kind of thinking
  and reasoning is quite valuable in software development too.

  How many different ways can we place two identical knights on an \(
  n \times n \) chessboard so that they attack each other?  Can we
  find a closed-form expression that gives this number?  This is the

  A knight moves two squares in one direction, then one square
  perpendicular to it, forming an L-shaped path.  If a piece occupies
  the destination square, the knight captures it.  If two knights are
  placed such that each can capture the other in a single move, then
  we say the knights attack each other.  We want to determine the
  number of ways to place two identical knights on an \( n \times n \)
  chessboard so that they attack each other.

    All \( 8 \) ways two identical knights can attack each other on a
    \( 3 \times 3 \) board.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Let \( f(n) \) denote the number of ways we can place two identical
  knights on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that they attack each
  other, where \( n \ge 1.  \)
</p>
<p>
  A \( 1 \times 1 \) board has room for only one knight, so we define
  \( f(1) = 0.  \)  On a \( 2 \times 2 \) board, a knight cannot move
  two squares in any direction and therefore cannot attack.
  Therefore, \( f(2) = 0.  \)  To summarise,

  \[
    f(1) = f(2) = 0.
  \]

  From the illustration above, we see that \( f(3) = 8.  \)  We want to
  find a closed-form expression for \( f(n).  \)
</p>
<p>
  We will analyse this problem from various perspectives.  We begin
  with a couple of needlessly complicated approaches, followed by a
  simple and elegant solution.  While I personally enjoy these
  long-winded explorations, if you prefer a more direct solution,
  please skip ahead
  to <a href="#counting-placements-from-minimal-attack-sections">Counting
  Placements From Minimal Attack Sections</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Before we proceed, let us introduce the term <em>mutually attacking
  knight placement</em> to mean a placement of two knights on the
  chessboard such that they attack each other.  Unless stated
  otherwise, the two knights are identical.  This term will serve as a
  convenient shorthand for referring to such placements.
</p>
<h2 id="counting-placements-as-the-board-grows">Counting Placements as the Board Grows<a href="#counting-placements-as-the-board-grows"></a></h2>
<p>
  We now turn to the needlessly complicated solution promised in the
  previous section.  We analyse the <em>new</em> mutually attacking
  knight placements introduced when an existing board is enlarged by
  adding a row and a column.
</p>
<p>
  Let us define

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = f(n) - f(n - 1)
  \]

  for \( n \ge 2, \) so that \( \Delta f(n) \) denotes the new
  mutually attacking knight placements introduced when an \( (n - 1)
  \times (n - 1) \) board is expanded to size \( n \times n \) by
  adding one row and one column.
</p>
<p>
  For brevity, we will avoid restating the process of enlarging an \(
  (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) board to an \( n \times n \) board by
  adding one row and one column whenever we refer to new placements.
  Instead, we use the term <em>new placements</em> on an
  \( n \times n \) board to refer to \( \Delta f(n).  \)  It is to be
  understood that these new placements are the mutually attacking
  knight placements introduced by enlarging the board from size \( (n
  - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to \( n \times n.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Without loss of generality, suppose the new row and column are added
  to the bottom and right respectively.  We already know that

  \begin{align*}
    \Delta f(2) &amp; = f(2) - f(1) = 0 - 0 = 0, \\
    \Delta f(3) &amp; = f(3) - f(2) = 8 - 0 = 8.  \\
  \end{align*}

  We will now find \( \Delta f(n) \) for \( n \ge 4.  \)  To do this,
  we first categorise the newly added squares due to board expansion,
  into four types, as illustrated below.

    New squares, labelled by type, as the board size increases from \(

<p>
  Here is a brief description of each square type:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Type A squares are the three new corner squares.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type B squares are the two new squares adjacent to type A squares
    at the top and left edges.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type C squares are the new squares that are <em>not</em> adjacent
    to any type A square.  If the new board has dimensions \( n \times
    n, \) where \( n \ge 4, \) then there are exactly \( 2n - 8 \)
    squares of type C.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type D squares are the two new squares adjacent to the
    bottom-right type A square.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We now calculate how many new mutually attacking knight placements
  are introduced by these additional squares as the board expands.  We
  proceed with a case-by-case analysis for each square type.
</p>
<h3 id="type-a-squares">Type A Squares<a href="#type-a-squares"></a></h3>
<p>
  There are three squares of type A.  If we place one knight on a type
  A square, there are two positions for the second knight such that
  the two knights attack each other.

<h3 id="type-c-squares">Type C Squares<a href="#type-c-squares"></a></h3>
<p>
  The number of type C squares depends on the board size.  When we
  increase the size of a board from \( (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to
  \(n \times n, \) where \( n \ge 4, \) we add \( n^2 - (n - 1)^2 = 2n
  - 1 \) new squares.  Among these, \( 3 \) are of type A, \( 2 \) are
  of type B and \( 2 \) are of type D.  That gives us a total of \(
  7 \) squares of type A, B or D.  The remaining \( 2n - 1 - 7 = 2n -
  8 \) squares are therefore of type C.  Note that when the board size
  increases from \( 3 \times 3 \) to \( 4 \times 4, \) there are \( 2
  \times 4 - 8 = 0 \) squares of type C.

  If we add the number of new mutually attacking knight placements
  found in each of the cases above, we get

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = 6 + 6 + 8(n - 4) + 4 = 8(n - 2)
  \]

  new mutually attacking knight placements as the board size increases
  from \( (n - 1) \times (n - 1) \) to \( n \times n, \) where \( n
  \ge 4.  \)  We already know that \( \Delta f(2) = 0 \) and \( \Delta
  f(3) = 8.  \)  Surprisingly, the above formula produces the correct
  values for those cases as well.  Therefore, we can generalise this
  result as

  \[
    \Delta f(n) = 8(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 2.  \)  We can now calculate \( f(n) \) for \( n \ge
  1 \) as follows:

  \begin{align*}
    f(n)
    &amp; = \sum_{k = 1}^n f(k) - \sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} f(k) \\
    &amp; = \sum_{k = 1}^n f(k) - \sum_{k = 2}^n f(k - 1) \\
    &amp; = f(1) + \sum_{k = 2}^n (f(k) - f(k - 1)) \\
    &amp; = f(1) + \sum_{k = 2}^n \Delta f(k) \\
    &amp; = 0 + \sum_{k = 2}^n 8(k - 2) \\
    &amp; = 8 \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 2} k \\
    &amp; = \frac{8(n - 2)(n - 1)}{2} \\
    &amp; = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \end{align*}

  To summarise, we now have a closed form expression for \( f(n).  \)
  For all \( n \ge 1, \) we have

  \[
    f(n) = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).

<p>
  The previous section took a long-winded path to arrive at a closed
  form expression for \( f(n).  \)  In this section, we will reach the
  same result that is still a bit drawn out, but not quite as much as
  before.
</p>
<p>
  This time, instead of looking only at the new squares created when
  the board grows, we consider <em>every</em> square on the board.  To
  make the counting easier, we no longer treat the knights as
  identical.  We first work with two distinct knights, count the
  mutually attacking knight placements and then divide the total by \(
  2 \) to get the result for identical knights.
</p>
<h3 id="attacking-degrees-of-squares">Attacking Degrees of Squares<a href="#attacking-degrees-of-squares"></a></h3>
<p>
  Here, we introduce the term <em>attacking degree of a square</em> to
  mean the number of squares a knight can move to from that square in
  a single move.  In other words, the attacking degree of a square is
  the number of squares that would be attacked if a knight were placed
  on it.  For example, the corner squares have an attacking degree of
  \( 2.  \)

  With eight such squares, we get \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) mutually

<p>
  Let \( g(n) \) be the number of mutually attacking knight placements
  on an \( n \times n \) board when the knights are distinct.  Then \(
  g(n) \) is simply the sum of the attacking degrees of all squares on
  the board.  As before, let \( f(n) \) denote the number of mutually
  attacking knight placements on an \( n \times n \) board when the
  two knights are identical.  We will now show that
  \( f(n) = g(n)/2.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Label all squares of the \( n \times n \) board as \( S_1, S_2,
  \dots, S_{n^2} \) in any fixed order.  Label the two distinct
  knights as \( N_1 \) and \( N_2.  \)  We represent each mutually
  attacking knight placement as an ordered pair \( (S_i, S_j) \) if \(
  N_1 \) is on \( S_i \) and \( N_2 \) is on \( S_j, \) with the two
  knights attacking each other.  Here \( 1 \le i, j \le n^2 \) and \(
  i \ne j.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Let \( M \) be the set of all mutually attacking knight placements
  for distinct knights on an \( n \times n \) board.  Then

  \[
    g(n) = \lvert M \rvert.
  \]

  If \( (S_i, S_j) \) is a mutually attacking knight placement of the
  distinct knights \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) for some \( i \) and
  \( j \) with \( 1 \le i, j \le n^2 \) and \( i \ne j, \) then \(
  (S_j, S_i) \) is also a mutually attacking knight placement, since
  swapping the positions of the two mutually attacking knights still
  yields a valid mutually attacking placement.  Therefore

  \[
    (S_i, S_j) \in M \iff (S_j, S_i) \in M.
  \]

  Each ordered placement \( (S_i, S_j) \) in \( M \) is thus paired
  with the ordered placement \( (S_j, S_i).  \)  When the knights are
  identical, the two arrangements are indistinguishable and count as
  one placement.  Hence, the number of mutually attacking placements
  for identical knights is exactly half of the number for distinct
  knights, i.e.

  \[
    f(n) = \frac{g(n)}{2}.
  \]

  The next subsection focuses on calculating \( g(n), \) from which \(
  f(n) \) follows immediately by the above formula.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-2">Closed Form Expression<a href="#closed-form-expression-2"></a></h3>
<p>
  As noted in the previous section, the number of mutually attacking
  knight placements for two distinct knights on an \( n \times n \)
  board is simply the sum of attacking degrees of all squares on the
  board.  If we label each square as discussed in the previous section
  and use the notation \( \deg(S_i) \) for the attacking degree of the
  square labelled \( S_i, \) where \( 1 \le i \le n^2, \) then

  \[
    g(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n^2} \deg(S_i).
  \]

  Recall that the attacking degree of a square is the number of
  squares a knight could attack if it were placed there.  Earlier, we
  saw that on a \( 3 \times 3 \) board, all squares except the centre
  one have attacking degree \( 2, \) which gives \( g(3) = 8 \times 2
  = 16 \) and \( f(3) = g(3)/2 = 8.  \)  Let us now write down the
  attacking degrees of all squares on a \( 4 \times 4 \) board.

  Let us find a general formula now for \( n \ge 4.  \)  We introduce
  one more notation.  Let \( D_k(n) \) denote the sum of the attacking
  degrees of all squares of attacking degree \( k \) on an \( n \times
  n \) board, i.e.

  \[
    D_k(n) = \sum_{\mathclap{\deg(S_i) = k}} \deg(S_i).
  \]

  Since the only attacking degrees the squares can have are \( 2, 3,
  4, 6 \) and \( 8, \) the sum of the attacking degrees of all squares
  can be written as

  \[
    g(n) = D_2(n) + D_3(n) + D_4(n) + D_6(n) + D_8(n).
  \]

  There are exactly four squares of attacking degree \( 2.  \)  These
  are the corner ones.  Therefore,

  \[
    D_2(n) = 4 \times 2 = 8.
  \]

  The eight squares adjacent to the corner squares have attacking
  degree \( 3.  \)  Therefore,

  \[
    D_3(n) = 8 \times 3 = 24.
  \]

  Let us define an <em>inner corner square</em> as one that shares a
  corner with a corner square but not an edge with it.  There are four
  inner corner squares and each has attacking degree \( 4.  \)
  Further, each row and column on the outer edge contains \( n - 4 \)
  additional squares with attacking degree \( 4.  \)  Therefore,

  \[
    D_4(n) = (4 + 4(n - 4))(4) = 16(n - 3).
  \]

  Consider a row or column that contains two inner corner squares of
  attacking degree \( 4.  \)  All \( n - 4 \) squares between the inner
  corner squares have attacking degree \( 6.  \)  There are two such
  rows and two such columns.  Therefore,

  \[
    D_6(n) = 4(n - 4)(6) = 24(n - 4).
  \]

  We have counted the attacking degrees of all squares in the first
  two columns and rows as well as the last two columns and rows.  We
  are left with \( (n - 4)^2 \) squares in the middle and they all
  have attacking degree \( 8.  \)  Therefore,

  \[
    D_8(n) = 8(n - 4)^2.
  \]

  Therefore,

  \begin{align*}
    g(n)
    &amp; = D_2(n) + D_3(n) + D_4(n) + D_6(n) + D_8(n) \\
    &amp; = 8 + 24 + 16(n - 3) + 24(n - 4) + 8(n - 4)^2 \\
    &amp; = 8(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \end{align*}

  Even though we assumed \( n \ge 4 \) while obtaining the above
  formula, remarkably, it gives us the correct values for \( n = 1,
  2 \) and \( 3.  \)  The number of mutually attacking knight
  placements for distinct knights on an \( n \times n \) board is \(
  0 \) if \( n = 1 \) or \( 2.  \)  It is \( 16 \) if \( n = 3.  \)
  Indeed the above formula gives us

  \[
    g(1) = g(2) = 0, \quad g(3) = 16.
  \]

  Therefore, we can now generalise the above result as

  \[
    g(n) = 8(n - 1)(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 1.  \)  Therefore, for all \( n \ge 1, \)

  \[
    f(n) = \frac{g(n)}{2} = 4(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \]

<p>
  Finally, in this section, we take a look at a simple and elegant
  solution that arrives at the closed-form solution in a more direct
  manner.  The analysis begins by looking at the smallest section of
  the board where two knights can attack each other.
</p>
<h3 id="minimal-attack-sections">Minimal Attack Sections<a href="#minimal-attack-sections"></a></h3>
<p>
  Consider a \( 2 \times 3 \) section of a board of size
  \( 3 \times 3 \) or larger.  Such a section has exactly two mutually
  attacking knight placements.

  two mutually attacking knight placements.

  <figcaption>
    Two mutually attacking knight placements on a \( 3 \times 2 \)
    section of a board
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  We call these \( 2 \times 3 \) and \( 3 \times 2 \) sections
  the <em>minimal attack sections</em> of a board, since no smaller
  section can contain a mutually attacking knight placement.
</p>
<p>
  Two distinct \( 2 \times 3 \) sections can share at most a \( 1
  \times 3 \) section, which is smaller than a minimal attack section.
  Consequently, no mutually attacking knight placement can be common
  to two distinct \( 2 \times 3 \) sections of a board.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, two distinct \( 3 \times 2 \) sections can share at most
  a \( 3 \times 1 \) section, again too small to contain a minimal
  attack section.  Therefore, they share no mutually attacking knight
  placement.
</p>
<p>
  A \( 2 \times 3 \) section and a \( 3 \times 2 \) section can share
  at most a \( 2 \times 2 \) section, which is still smaller than a
  minimal attack section, so they share no mutually attacking knight
  placement either.
</p>
<p>
  To summarise, any two minimal attack sections of the board yield
  distinct pairs of mutually attacking knight placements.  The total
  number of such placements is therefore exactly twice the number of
  minimal attack sections on the board.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-3">Closed Form Expression<a href="#closed-form-expression-3"></a></h3>
<p>
  In an \( n \times n \) board where \( n \ge 3, \) the left edge of a
  \( 2 \times 3 \) section can be placed in any one of the first \( n
  - 2 \) columns of the board.  Similarly, the top edge of such a
  section can be placed in any one of the first \( n - 1 \) rows of
  the board.  Therefore, the total number of distinct \( 2 \times 3 \)
  sections on the board is \( (n - 2)(n - 1).  \)
</p>
<p>
  By similar reasoning, the number of distinct \( 3 \times 2 \)
  sections on an \( n \times n \) board, where \( n \ge 3, \) is also
  \( (n - 1)(n - 2).  \)
</p>
<p>
  Let \( h(n) \) be the total number of minimal attack sections we can
  find on an \( n \times n \) board where \( n \ge 1.  \)  From the
  discussion in the previous two paragraphs, we know that \( h(n) =
  2(n - 1)(n - 2) \) for \( n \ge 3.  \)  Further, this formula for \(
  h(n) \) works for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \) as well since \( h(1)
  = h(2) = 0 \) and indeed a \( 1 \times 1 \) board or a
  \( 2 \times 2 \) board is too small to contain any minimal attack
  sections.  Therefore, for all \( n \ge 1, \) we get

  \[
    h(n) = 2(n - 1)(n - 2).
  \]

  Since each minimal attack section yields two mutually attacking
  knight placements, the total number of mutually attacking knight
  placements on an \( n \times n \) board is

  \[
    f(n) = 2h(n) = 4(n - 1)(n - 2)
  \]

  for all \( n \ge 1.  \)

  Consider the following infinite grid of numbers, where the numbers
  are arranged in a spiral-like manner, but the spiral reverses
  direction each time it reaches the edge of the grid:

  \begin{array}{rcrcrcrcrl}

  Before we explore this problem further, let us rewrite the zigzag
  number spiral grid in a cleaner form, omitting the arrows:

  \begin{array}{rrrrrl}
      1 &amp;   2 &amp;   9  &amp;  10 &amp;  25 &amp; \cd \\
      4 &amp;   3 &amp;   8  &amp;  11 &amp;  24 &amp; \cd \\
      5 &amp;   6 &amp;   7  &amp;  12 &amp;  23 &amp; \cd \\
     16 &amp;  15 &amp;  14  &amp;  13 &amp;  22 &amp; \cd \\
     17 &amp;  18 &amp;  19  &amp;  20 &amp;  21 &amp; \cd \\
    \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \vd  &amp; \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \dd
  \end{array}

  Let \( f(m, n) \) denote the number at the \( m \)th row and
  \( n \)th column.  For example, \( f(1, 1) = 1 \) and \( f(2, 5) =
  24.  \)  We want to find a closed-form expression for \( f(m, n).  \)
</p>
<p>
  Let us first clarify what we mean by a <em>closed-form
  expression</em>.  There is no universal definition of a closed-form
  expression, but the term typically refers to a mathematical
  expression involving variables and constants, built using a finite
  combination of basic operations: addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, division, integer exponents, roots with integer
  index and functions such as exponentials, logarithms and
  trigonometric functions.
</p>
<p>
  In this article, however, we need only addition, subtraction,
  division, squares and square roots.  This may be a bit of a spoiler,
  but I must mention that the \( \max \) function appears in the
  closed-form expressions we are about to see.  If you are concerned
  about whether functions like \( \max \) and \( \min \) are permitted
  in such expressions, note that

  \begin{align*}
    \max(m, n) &amp; = \frac{m + n + \sqrt{(m - n)^2}}{2}, \\
    \min(m, n) &amp; = \frac{m + n - \sqrt{(m - n)^2}}{2}.
  \end{align*}

  So \( \max \) and \( \min \) are simply shorthand for expressions
  involving addition, subtraction, division, squares and square roots.
  In the discussion that follows, we will use only the \( \max \)
  function.
</p>
<h2 id="patterns-on-the-edges">Patterns on the Edges<a href="#patterns-on-the-edges"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us begin by analysing the edge numbers.  Number the rows as \(
  1, 2, 3 \dots \) and the columns likewise.  Observe where the spiral
  touches the left edge and changes direction.  This happens only on
  even-numbered rows.  Similarly, each time the spiral touches the top
  edge and changes direction, it does so on odd-numbered columns.  In
  the following subsections, we take a closer look at this behaviour
  of the spiral.
</p>
<p>
  I should mention that this section takes a rather long path to
  arrive at the closed-form solution.  Personally, I enjoy such long
  tours.  If you prefer a more direct approach, feel free to skip
  ahead to
  <a href="#patterns-on-the-diagonal">Patterns on the Diagonal</a> for
  a shorter discussion that reaches the same result.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-edge-numbers">Computing Edge Numbers<a href="#computing-edge-numbers"></a></h3>
<p>
  Each time the spiral reaches the left edge of the grid, it does so
  at some \( m \)th row where \( m \) is even.  The \( m \times m \)
  subgrid formed by the first \( m \) rows and the first \( m \)
  columns contains \( m^2 \) consecutive numbers.  Since the numbers
  strictly increase as the spiral grows, the largest of these
  \( m^2 \) numbers must appear at the position where the spiral
  touches the left edge.  This is illustrated in the figure below.
</p>
<figure>
  \begin{array}{rrrr:rl}
     1     &amp;   2 &amp;   9  &amp;  10 &amp;  25 &amp; \cd \\

     5     &amp;   6 &amp;   7  &amp;  12 &amp;  23 &amp; \cd \\
    \hl 16 &amp;  15 &amp;  14  &amp;  13 &amp;  22 &amp; \cd \\
    \hdashline
    17     &amp;  18 &amp;  19  &amp;  20 &amp;  21 &amp; \cd \\
    \vd    &amp; \vd &amp; \vd  &amp; \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \dd
  \end{array}
  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the left edge on the \( 4 \)th row where the
    number is \( 4^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Whenever the spiral touches the left edge at the \( m \)th row
  (where \( m \) is even), the number in the first column of that row
  is \( m^2.  \)  Hence, we conclude that \( f(m, 1) = m^2 \) when \( m
  \) is even.  Immediately after touching the left edge, the spiral
  turns downwards into the first column of the next row.  Thus, in the
  next row, i.e. in the \( (m + 1) \)th row, we have \( f(m + 1, 1) =
  m^2 + 1, \) where \( m + 1 \) is odd.  This can be restated as \(
  f(m, 1) = (m - 1)^2 + 1 \) when \( m \) is odd.  Since \( f(1, 1) =
  1, \) we can summarise the two formulas we have found here as:

  \[
    f(m, 1) =
      \begin{cases}
        m^2           &amp; \text{if } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + 1 &amp; \text{if } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
      \end{cases}
  \]
</p>
<p>
  We can perform a similar analysis for the numbers at the top edge
  and note that whenever the spiral touches the top edge at the
  \( n \)th column (where \( n \) is odd), the number in the first row
  of that column is \( n^2.  \)  This is illustrated below.
</p>
<figure>
  \begin{array}{rrr:rrl}

    \vd &amp; \vd &amp;  \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \dd
  \end{array}
  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the top edge on the \( 3 \)rd column where the
    number is \( 3^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Immediately after touching the top edge, the spiral turns right into
  the next column.  These observations give us the following formula
  for the numbers at the top edge:

  \[
    f(1, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        n^2           &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        (n - 1)^2 + 1 &amp; \text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Next we will find a formula for any arbitrary number anywhere in the
  grid.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-all-grid-numbers-1">Computing All Grid Numbers<a href="#computing-all-grid-numbers-1"></a></h3>
<p>
 Since the spiral touches the left edge on even-numbered rows, then
 turns downwards into the next (odd-numbered) row and then starts
 moving right until the diagonal (where it changes direction again),
 the following two rules hold:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    On every odd-numbered row, as we go from left to right, the
    numbers increase until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
  <li>
    On every even-numbered row, as we go from left to right, the
    numbers decrease until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that all the numbers we considered in the above two points lie
  on or below the diagonal (or equivalently, on or to the left of the
  diagonal).  Therefore, on an odd-numbered row, we can find the
  numbers on or below the diagonal using the formula \( f(m, n) = f(m,
  1) + (n - 1), \) where \( m \) is odd.  Similarly, on even-numbered
  rows, we can find the numbers on or below the diagonal using the
  formula \( f(m, n) = f(m, 1) - (n - 1), \) where \( m \) is even.
</p>
<p>
  By a similar analysis, the following rules hold when we consider the
  numbers in a column:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    On every even-numbered column, as we go from top to bottom, the
    numbers increase until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
  <li>
    On every odd-numbered column, as we go from top to bottom, the
    numbers decrease until we reach the diagonal.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Now the numbers on or above the diagonal can be found using the
  formula \( f(m, n) = f(1, n) - (m - 1) \) when \( n \) is odd and \(
  f(m, n) = f(1, n) + (m - 1), \) when \( n \) is even.
</p>
<p>
  Can we determine from the values of \( m \) and \( n \) if the
  number \( f(m, n) \) is above the diagonal or below it?  Yes, if \(
  m \le n, \) then \( f(m, n) \) lies on or above the diagonal.
  However, if \( m \ge n, \) then \( f(m, n) \) lies on or below the
  diagonal.
</p>
<p>
  We now have everything we need to write a general formula for
  finding the numbers anywhere in the grid.  Using the four formulas
  and the two inequalities obtained in this section, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(1, n) + (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(1, n) - (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, 1) - (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, 1) + (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Using the equations for \( f(1, n) \) and \( f(m, 1) \) from the
  previous section, the above formulas can be rewritten as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n - 1)^2 + 1 + (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        n^2 - (m - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        m^2 - (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + 1 + (n - 1)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Simplifying the expressions on the right-hand side, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n - 1)^2 + m
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        n^2 - m + 1
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        m^2 - n + 1
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m - 1)^2 + n
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  This is pretty good.  We now have a piecewise formula that works for
  any position in the grid.  Let us now explore whether we can express
  it as a single closed-form expression.
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-1">Closed Form Expression<a href="#closed-form-expression-1"></a></h3>
<p>
  First, we will rewrite the piecewise formula from the previous
  section in the following form:

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        (n^2 - n + 1) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (n^2 - n + 1) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m^2 - m + 1) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        (m^2 - m + 1) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  This is the same formula, rewritten to reveal common patterns
  between the four expressions on the right-hand side.  In each
  expression, one variable plays the dominant role, occurring several
  times, while the other appears only once.  For example, in the first
  two expressions, \( n \) plays the dominant role whereas \( m \)
  occurs only once.  If we look closely, we realise that it is the
  variable that is greater than or equal to the other that plays the
  dominant role.  Therefore the first and third expressions may be
  written as

  \[
    \left( (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 \right) + (m - n).
  \]

  Similarly, the second and fourth expressions may be written as

  \[
    \left( (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 \right) - (m - n).
  \]

  We have made some progress towards a closed-form expression.  We
  have collapsed the four expressions in the piecewise formula to just
  two.  The only difference between them lies in the sign of the
  second term: it is positive when the dominant variable is even and
  negative when it is odd.  This observation allows us to unify both
  cases into a single expression:

  \[
    f(m, n) = (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  Now we have a closed-form expression for \( f(m, n) \) that gives
  the number at any position in the grid.
</p>
<h2 id="patterns-on-the-diagonal">Patterns on the Diagonal<a href="#patterns-on-the-diagonal"></a></h2>
<p>
  As mentioned earlier, there is a shorter route to the same
  closed-form expression.  This alternative approach is based on
  analysing the numbers along the diagonal of the grid.  We still need
  to examine the edge numbers, but not all of them as we did in the
  previous section.  Some of the reasoning about edge values will be
  repeated here to ensure this section is self-contained.
</p>
<h3 id="computing-diagonal-numbers">Computing Diagonal Numbers<a href="#computing-diagonal-numbers"></a></h3>
<p>
  A number on the diagonal has the same row number and column number.
  In other words, a diagonal number has the value \( f(n, n) \) for
  some positive integer \( n.  \)  Consider the case when \( n \) is
  even.  In this case, the diagonal number is on a segment of the
  spiral that is moving to the left.  The \( n \times n \) subgrid
  formed by the first \( n \) rows and the first \( n \) columns
  contains exactly \( n^2 \) consecutive numbers.  Since the diagonal
  number is on the last row of this subgrid and the numbers in this
  row increase as we move from right to left, the largest number in
  the subgrid must be on the left edge of this row.  Therefore the
  number at the left edge is \( f(n, 1) = n^2, \) where \( n \) is
  even.  This is illustrated below.
</p>
<figure>
  \begin{array}{rrrr:rl}
     1     &amp;   2 &amp;   9  &amp;     10 &amp;  25 &amp; \cd \\
     4     &amp;   3 &amp;   8  &amp;     11 &amp;  24 &amp; \cd \\

    \hdashline
    17     &amp;  18 &amp;  19  &amp;     20 &amp;  21 &amp; \cd \\
    \vd    &amp; \vd &amp; \vd  &amp;    \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \dd
  \end{array}
  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the left edge on the \( 4 \)th row where the
    number is \( 4^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  From the diagonal to the edge of the subgrid, there are \( n \)
  consecutive numbers.  In a sequence of \( n \) consecutive numbers,
  the difference between the maximum number and the minimum number is
  \( n - 1.  \)  Therefore, \( n^2 - f(n, n) = n - 1.  \)  This gives us

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \quad \text{if } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
  \]
</p>
<p>
  Now consider the case when \( n \) is odd.
</p>
<figure>
  \begin{array}{rrr:rrl}
     1 &amp;   2 &amp; \hl 9 &amp;  10 &amp;  25 &amp; \cd \\
     4 &amp;   3 &amp;     8 &amp;  11 &amp;  24 &amp; \cd \\
     5 &amp;   6 &amp; \hl 7 &amp;  12 &amp;  23 &amp; \cd \\
    \hdashline
    16 &amp;  15 &amp;    14 &amp;  13 &amp;  22 &amp; \cd \\
    17 &amp;  18 &amp;    19 &amp;  20 &amp;  21 &amp; \cd \\
    \vd &amp; \vd &amp;  \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \vd &amp; \dd
  \end{array}
  <figcaption>
    The spiral touches the top edge on the \( 3 \)rd column where the
    number is \( 3^2 \)
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  By a similar reasoning, for odd \( n, \) the \( n \)th column has
  numbers that increase as we move up from the diagonal number towards
  the top edge.  Therefore \( f(1, n) = n^2 \) and since \( n^2 - f(n,
  n) = n - 1, \) we again obtain

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \quad \text{if } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
  \]

  Since \( f(n, n) \) takes the same form for both odd and even
  \( n, \) we can write

  \[
    f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1
  \]

  for all positive integers \( n.  \)
</p>
<h3 id="computing-all-grid-numbers-2">Computing All Grid Numbers<a href="#computing-all-grid-numbers-2"></a></h3>
<p>
  If \( m \le n, \) then the number \( f(m, n) \) lies on or above the
  diagonal number \( f(n, n).  \)  If \( n \) is even, then the numbers
  decrease as we go from the diagonal up to the top edge.  Therefore
  \( f(m, n) \le f(n, n) \) and \( f(m, n) = f(n, n) - (n - m).  \)  If
  \( n \) is odd, then the numbers increase as we go from the diagonal
  up to the top edge and therefore \( f(m, n) \ge f(n, n) \) and \(
  f(m, n) = f(n, n) + (n - m).  \)
</p>
<p>
  If \( m \ge n, \) then the number \( f(m, n) \) lies on or below the
  diagonal number \( f(m, m).  \)  By a similar analysis, we find that
  \( f(m, n) = f(m, m) + (m - n) \) if \( n \) is even and \( f(m, n)
  = f(m, m) - (m - n) \) if \( n \) is odd.  We summarise these
  results as follows:

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(n, n) - (n - m)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(n, n) + (n - m)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  Note that the above formula can be rewritten as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(n, n) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(n, n) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \le n \text{ and } n \equiv 1 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(m, m) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } m \ge n \text{ and } m \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]
</p>
<h3 id="closed-form-expression-2">Closed Form Expression<a href="#closed-form-expression-2"></a></h3>
<p>
  If we take a close look at the last formula in the previous section,
  we find that in each expression, one variable plays a dominant role,
  i.e. it occurs more frequently in the expression than the other.  In
  the first two expressions \( n \) plays the dominant role whereas in
  the last two expressions \( m \) plays the dominant role.  In fact,
  in each expression, the dominant variable is the one that is greater
  than or equal to the other.  With this in mind, we can rewrite the
  above formula as

  \[
    f(m, n) =
      \begin{cases}
        f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) + (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } \max(m, n) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}, \\
        f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) - (m - n)
        &amp; \text{if } \max(m, n) \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.  \\
      \end{cases}
  \]

  The only difference between the expressions is the sign of the
  second term: it is positive when \( \max(m, n) \) is even and
  negative when \( \max(m, n) \) is odd.  As a result, we can rewrite
  the above formula as a single expression like this:

  \[
    f(m, n) = f(\max(m, n), \max(m, n)) + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  Using the formula \( f(n, n) = n^2 - n + 1 \) from the previous
  section, we get

  \[
    f(m, n) = (\max(m, n))^2 - \max(m, n) + 1 + (-1)^{\max(m, n)} (m - n).
  \]

  We arrive again at the same closed-form expression, this time by
  focusing on the diagonal of the grid.

<title>My Blogroll Is Now My Feed Reader</title>
<link>https://susam.net/blogroll-as-feed-reader.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  On a particularly hot summer weekend last month, I implemented a new
  feature for this website: a blogroll that lists recent entries from
  my favourite blogs.  Check it out here: <a href="roll.html">roll.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It has been nearly two weeks since I set up this blogroll and it has
  already changed how I keep up with my feeds.  I no longer bother
  with feed readers or aggregators.  I could never quite make a habit
  of using them regularly anyway.  Thanks to this simple addition to
  my website, I find myself visiting my blogroll often.  It has earned
  a permanent place in my bookmarks.  When I have some spare time, I
  click on the bookmark, visit my blogroll and, when I find new posts
  appear there, I click through and read the full blog posts.
</p>
<p>
  Credit for this nifty and surprisingly effective idea goes to Alex
  Kladov.  It was Alex's website,
  <a href="https://matklad.github.io/">matklad.github.io</a>, that
  inspired me to implement my own blogroll.  It showed me that a
  blogroll can be more than just a static list of links.  It can be a
  regularly updated page that highlights new posts from the blogs I
  follow.
</p>
<p>
  I suspect the fact that my blogroll is generated by my own
  handcrafted <a href="https://github.com/susam/susam.net/blob/main/roll.lisp">Common
  Lisp program</a> plays a part in why I enjoy using it.  There is a
  certain joy in using something you have built yourself.  At last, I
  feel I can stay on top of my feeds!  If you maintain a personal
  website and struggle to keep up with your feeds, I recommend this
  approach.  Writing the blogroll generator was a fun weekend project
  and it has greatly improved how I spend my spare time online!

<title>Million Times Million</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Is a million times a million a <em>billion</em> or is it
  a <em>trillion</em>?  For my entire childhood, it was a billion,
  only for me to grow up and realise, as an adult, that it had better
  be a trillion!
</p>
<h2 id="growing-up-with-the-long-scale">Growing Up With the Long Scale<a href="#growing-up-with-the-long-scale"></a></h2>
<p>
  As a child, I stumbled upon an old dictionary lying around our house
  and that was where I discovered the names of large numbers.  The
  dictionary used the long scale system, which is based on powers of a
  million.  According to the long scale system,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a million times a million is a billion,
  </li>
  <li>
    a million times a million times a million is a trillion,
  </li>
  <li>
    a million multiplied by itself four times is a quadrillion,
  </li>
  <li>
    multiply it five times and we get a quintillion
  </li>
  <li>
    and so on.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These long scale names made a lot of sense to me.  Each name told us
  exactly how many times we multiplied a million by itself.  The
  little prefix at the start, like <em>bi-</em>, <em>tri-</em>,
  <em>quadri-</em>, <em>quinti-</em>, etc. matched the number of times
  a million appeared in the multiplication: twice for a billion, three
  times for a trillion and so on.  If I came across a number like
  quintillion, I immediately knew it meant a million multiplied by
  itself five times, so a quintillion had to be \( (10^6)^5 =
  10^{30}.  \)  It was simple and intuitive.
</p>
<p>
  Now imagine my disappointment when I left home for university, got
  access to computers and the World Wide Web and discovered that the
  names I had learnt were off by several orders of magnitude compared
  with what everyone else was using.  The long scale names I had grown
  up with were irrelevant in this new world I was stepping into.  It
  was the short scale that had taken over most of the technology
  world, especially in computing.  In the short scale, a million times
  a million is no longer a billion.  Instead, somehow, it is a
  trillion!  Similarly, a million multiplied three times is no longer
  a trillion.  It is a quintillion!  What on earth was going on?
</p>
<p>
  Naturally, I had to go through a period of adjustment, letting go of
  my old intuition for the long scale names and getting used to the
  short scale ones.  At the same time, I found a way to trick my mind
  into making sense of the short scale.  Before I get into the mental
  gymnastics that made the short scale click for me, let us first take
  a quick look at the long scale and short scale names side by side.
</p>
<h2 id="same-names-different-numbers">Same Names, Different Numbers<a href="#same-names-different-numbers"></a></h2>
<p>
  The long scale and short scale are simply two different ways of
  naming large numbers.  To see how they differ, here is a table
  showing what each name corresponds to in the two systems.
</p>
<table class="grid center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number</th>
      <th>Long Scale</th>
      <th>Short Scale</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^6 \)</td>
      <td>Million</td>
      <td>Million</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^9 \)</td>
      <td>Milliard</td>
      <td>Billion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{12} \)</td>
      <td>Billion</td>
      <td>Trillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{15} \)</td>
      <td>Billiard</td>
      <td>Quadrillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{18} \)</td>
      <td>Trillion</td>
      <td>Quintillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{21} \)</td>
      <td>Trilliard</td>
      <td>Sextillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{24} \)</td>
      <td>Quadrillion</td>
      <td>Septillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{27} \)</td>
      <td>Quadrilliard</td>
      <td>Octillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{30} \)</td>
      <td>Quintillion</td>
      <td>Nonillion</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\( 10^{33} \)</td>
      <td>Quintilliard</td>
      <td>Decillion</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  As the table shows, the two systems agree on the value of a million,
  but diverge immediately after.  From that point on, the same names
  represent increasingly different magnitudes.
</p>
<h2 id="making-sense-of-the-short-scale">Making Sense of the Short Scale<a href="#making-sense-of-the-short-scale"></a></h2>
<p>
  I used to quite like the long scale names because the prefix in each
  name is determined by how many times we multiply a million by
  itself.  Each prefix reflects the value of \( n \) in the number \(
  10^{6n}, \) where \( n \) is a positive integer.  For example, if \(
  n = 3, \) we get \( 10^{18}, \) which in the long scale is called
  a <em>trillion</em>.  But in the short scale, the same number is
  called a <em>quintillion</em>.  How can we make sense of it?
</p>
<p>
  One way to interpret the short scale is to count how many additional
  thousands are multiplied onto one thousand.  A thousand is, of
  course, just <em>one thousand</em>.  Multiply it by another thousand
  and we get a <em>million</em>.  Multiply that by another thousand
  and we get a <em>billion</em>.  One more multiplication gives us
  a <em>trillion</em> and so on.  I do not find this quite as neat as
  the long scale but it works.
</p>
<p>
  In effect, the prefix in the short scale corresponds to \( n \) of
  the integer \( 1000 \times 1000^n, \) where \( n \) is a positive
  integer.  Stated more succinctly, it represents \( n \) of \(
  10^{3(n + 1)}.  \)  So for example, if \( n = 5, \) then

  \[
    10^{3(n + 1)} = 10^{18},
  \]

  which is called a <em>quintillion</em> in the short scale.  The
  <em>quinti-</em> prefix still represents five but now it is tied to
  the number of additional thousands we multiplied to the first
  thousand.  It is not quite the elegant pattern I grew up with but
  this is the convention that dominates today.  In the world of
  technology, computing and finance, as well as in most
  English-speaking contexts, the short scale has prevailed.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  Today, of course, I use only the short scale, because that is the
  convention adopted by the part of the world relevant to me.  I no
  longer use the long scale.  But it remains in memory, simply because
  I spent a large part of my early life with it.  It still lives in
  some corner of my heart, partly out of nostalgia and partly due to
  its elegance.

<title>Noise From My Feeds</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  Hello!  If you are subscribed to this website's feeds, you may have
  noticed something odd recently.  Your feed reader might have shown a
  bunch of old posts as if they were published today.  If that
  happened with your feed reader, I apologise for the noise.  I hope
  this post will give you some clarity on why this happened.  The
  reason for this noise is a change to the way the RSS feeds are
  generated for this website.  Each post in the feeds includes a GUID,
  which is used by many feed readers to decide whether a post is new
  or if it has been seen already.  Until now, the GUID was simply the
  post's URL, like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;url&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;guid&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/guid&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  However, today this has changed to a short unique string, like so:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;url&gt;https://susam.net/product-of-additive-inverses.html&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;guid isPermaLink="false"&gt;rxpnz&lt;/guid&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If your feed reader looks at this GUID value to decide whether a new
  post has been published, it will show you a whole bunch of old posts
  once again in your reader, as if they were new.  These GUIDs won't
  change again in the future, so this is a one-time problem.  The full
  URL of the post is still present in the feeds, as you can see in the
  example above, so your feed reader still knows where to take you if
  you wish to visit this website to read a post.  The short string
  serves as a unique identifier for each post.
</p>
<p>
  This website is a passion project I work on in my spare time.
  Sometimes, after publishing a post, I realise the title could be
  sharper or the URL could be cleaner.  I make the necessary changes
  and set up HTTP redirects on my web server, so that visitors using
  the old URL are still taken to the updated location of the post.
  Previously, however, the GUID (being the URL) changed too, which
  caused many feed readers to treat the updated post as a new one even
  when it wasn't.  Switching to stable GUIDs prevents this problem
  from occurring again.  The GUIDs now stay the same no matter what
  changes I make behind the scenes, which means no more unnecessary
  noise in your feed reader.
</p>
<p>
  I am sorry if this caused any confusion or clutter.  If your feed
  reader is currently flooded with old posts appearing as new, the
  best solution is to mark those items as read.  Thank you for your
  patience with this issue.  I hope to keep future surprises limited
  to content, not configuration.
</p>

  A negative number multiplied by another negative number results in a
  positive number.  Most of us learnt this rule during our primary or
  secondary school years.  'Negative times negative equals positive'
  was a phrase drummed into us during mathematics lessons.  In this
  article, we will prove this rule, not just for numbers but for any
  algebraic structure that, in a general sense, behaves somewhat like
  numbers.
</p>

  <li><a href="#alternate-proof">Alternate Proof</a></li>
  <li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="illustration">Illustration<a href="#illustration"></a></h2>
<p>
  Let us begin with a quick illustration that shows why the product of
  two negative numbers must be positive for arithmetic to make sense.
  Consider

  \[
    7 \times 8 = 56.
  \]

  The above equation can also be written as

  \[
    (10 - 3) \times (10 - 2) = 56.
  \]

  Using the distributive property of multiplication over subtraction,
  we get

  \[
    (10 - 3) \times 10 + (10 - 3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Using the distributive property again, we have

  \[
    10 \times 10 + (-3) \times 10 + 10 \times (-2) + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Now, we will take it for granted that a positive times a negative is
  negative.  We will prove all of this rigorously later, but for now,
  we are just working through an illustration, so we will accept that
  rule and see where it leads.  The equation becomes:

  \[
    100 + (-30) + (-20) + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Adding the first three terms gives

  \[
    50 + (-3) \times (-2) = 56.
  \]

  Subtracting \( 50 \) from both sides, we get

  \[
    (-3) \times (-2) = 6.
  \]

  What we have seen here is that if we accept \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \)
  and that positive times negative gives a negative result, then we
  must also accept that \( (-3) \times (-2) = 6.  \)
</p>
<h2 id="ring-axioms">Ring Axioms<a href="#ring-axioms"></a></h2>
<p>
  From this section onwards, we take a rigorous approach.  We want to
  show that the rule 'negative times negative equals positive' holds,
  in a general sense, for any set of elements that share certain
  properties with numbers.  As it turns out, these elements do not
  need to possess all the properties of complex numbers, real numbers,
  or even rational numbers.  In fact, if they satisfy a small and
  specific set of properties held by the integers, then the rule still
  holds.  These properties are known as the <em>ring axioms</em>.
</p>
<p>
  A ring is an algebraic structure consisting of a set \( R \) with
  two binary operations \( + \) and \( \cdot, \) called addition and
  multiplication respectively, satisfying the following axioms:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c
      \in R, \) we have \( a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Commutativity of addition:</strong> For all \( a, b \in
      R, \) we have \( a + b = b + a.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive identity:</strong> There exists an element \( 0
      \in R \) such that for all \( a \in R, \) we have \( a + 0 = a =
      0 + a.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Additive inverse:</strong> For each \( a \in R, \) there
      exists an element \( -a \in R \) such that \( a + (-a) = 0 =
      (-a) + a.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Associativity of multiplication:</strong> For all \( a,
      b, c \in R, \) we have \( a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b)
      \cdot c.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Left distributivity of multiplication over
      addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in R, \) we have \( a
      \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Right distributivity of multiplication over
      addition:</strong> For all \( a, b, c \in R, \) we have \( (b +
      c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Note that we do not assume that the ring contains multiplicative
  identity, nor do we assume that multiplication is commutative.  Many
  familiar types of numbers form rings.  For example, the set of
  integers forms a ring with the usual addition and multiplication
  operations.  The sets of rational numbers, real numbers and complex
  numbers satisfy the ring axioms too.
</p>
<p>
  Rings need not consist of numbers; they may contain elements
  of <em>any</em> type.  As long as a set of elements, together with
  suitable addition and multiplication operations, satisfies the seven
  axioms above, it forms a ring.  For example, the set of all
  polynomials in the indeterminate \( t \) with coefficients in some
  ring \( R \) forms a ring under the usual addition and
  multiplication of polynomials.  Such a ring is called
  a <em>polynomial ring</em> and it is denoted \( R[t].  \)
</p>
<h2 id="closure-properties">Closure Properties<a href="#closure-properties"></a></h2>
<p>
  Some texts include the following additional axioms for the closure
  properties of a ring:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under addition:</strong> For all
      \( a, b \in R, \) we have \( a + b \in R.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Closure under multiplication:</strong> For all \( a, b
      \in R, \) we have \( a \cdot b \in R.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  However, stating these axioms explicitly is usually considered
  redundant because a binary operation is closed by definition.  A
  binary operation \( \circ \) on a set \( M \) is defined to be a
  function

  \[
    \circ : M \times M \to M; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a \circ b.
  \]

  This definition automatically implies the closure property, since
  the domain and codomain are the same.  The addition and
  multiplication operations on a ring \( R \) may be defined as

  \begin{align*}
        + &amp;: R \times R \to R; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a + b, \\
    \cdot &amp;: R \times R \to R; \quad (a, b) \mapsto a \cdot b.
  \end{align*}

  These definitions imply that a ring is closed under addition and
  multiplication.  In practice, while deciding if some set \( R \)
  forms a ring, we should always verify that the addition and
  multiplication operations indeed have \( R \) as the codomain to
  confirm that the closure property holds.
</p>
<h2 id="inverse-of-inverse">Inverse of Inverse<a href="#inverse-of-inverse"></a></h2>
<p id="theorem-1">
  <strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.
    Then for all \( a \in R, \) we have

    \[
      -(-a) = a.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> This result follows directly from the additive
  inverse axiom.  First, observe that

  \[
    a + (-a) = 0.
  \]

  Therefore \( a \) is an additive inverse of \( -a, \) i.e.

  \[
    -(-a) = a.
  \]

  This completes the proof.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that this proof does not involve the multiplication operation
  of a ring at all.  In fact, it holds true in a more general
  algebraic structure known as a <em>group</em>, which requires only a
  binary operation with associativity, an identity element and
  inverses.  A ring, under addition, is also a group.  Since the proof
  relies solely on these additive group properties, this theorem holds
  for all groups.  However, for brevity and to avoid introducing group
  axioms separately, I have stated and proved this theorem in the
  context of rings.
</p>
<p>
  It is also worth noting that the additive identity is unique in a
  ring (as well as in any group), but since this fact is not needed
  for later results, its proof has been omitted.  Even if,
  hypothetically, there were two distinct additive identities, \( 0 \)
  and \( 0', \) in a ring (there are not, of course), the arguments
  below would still hold if we simply focus on \( 0.  \)
</p>
<h2 id="multiplication-by-zero">Multiplication by Zero<a href="#multiplication-by-zero"></a></h2>
<p id="theorem-2">
  <strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.  Then
    for all \( a \in R, \) we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> Using the additive identity axiom, we get

  \[
    0 + 0 = 0.
  \]

  Multiplying both sides on the left by \( a, \) we get

  \[
    a \cdot (0 + 0) = a \cdot 0.
  \]

  Using the left distributivity axiom, we get

  \[
    a \cdot 0 + a \cdot 0 = a \cdot 0.
  \]

  Let \( b = a \cdot 0.  \)  Then

  \[
    b + b = b.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication, \( b \in R.  \)  By the
  additive inverse axiom, there exists \( -b \in R \) such that \( b +
  (-b) = 0.  \)  Adding \( -b \) to both sides of the above equation,
  we get

  \[
    (b + b) + (-b) = b + (-b).
  \]

  By associativity of addition in a ring, we get

  \[
    b + (b + (-b)) = b + (-b).
  \]

  Since \( b + (-b) = 0, \) the above equation becomes

  \[
    b + 0 = 0.
  \]

  By the additive identity axiom, we get

  \[
    b = 0.
  \]

  Since \( b = a \cdot 0, \) the above equation may be written as

  \[
    a \cdot 0 = 0.
  \]

  A similar argument shows that

  \[
    0 \cdot a = 0.
  \]

  This completes the proof.

<p id="theorem-3">
  <strong>Theorem 3.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.
    Then for all \( a, b \in R, \) we have

    \begin{align*}

      (-a) \cdot b &amp;= -(a \cdot b).
    \end{align*}
    </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em> Using the left distributivity and additive inverse
  properties of a ring along with <a href="#theorem-2">Theorem 2</a>,
  we get

  \[
    a \cdot b + a \cdot (-b)
    = a \cdot (b + (-b))
    = a \cdot 0
    = 0.
  \]

  Therefore \( a \cdot (-b) \) is an additive inverse of \( a \cdot b
 , \) i.e.

  \[
    -(a \cdot b) = a \cdot (-b).
  \]

  Similarly

  \[
    a \cdot b + (-a) \cdot b
    = (a + (-a)) \cdot b
    = 0 \cdot b
    = 0
  \]

  and thus

  \[
    -(a \cdot b) = (-a) \cdot b.
  \]

  This completes the proof.
</p>
<h2 id="product-of-additive-inverses">Product of Additive Inverses<a href="#product-of-additive-inverses"></a></h2>
<p>
  <strong>Theorem 4.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring with \( + \) and \( \cdot \) operations.  Then
    for all \( a, b \in R, \) we have

    \[
      (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Proof.</em>
  From <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a>, we know that

  \[
    a \cdot (-b) = -(a \cdot b).
  \]

  Substituting \( a \) with \( -a, \) we get

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = -((-a) \cdot b).
  \]

  Again by <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a>, we have \( (-a) \cdot b
  = -(a \cdot b).  \)  Substituting this in the above equation, we
  obtain

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = -(-(a \cdot b)).
  \]

  Now using <a href="#theorem-1">Theorem 1</a>, the right-hand side
  becomes \( a \cdot b, \) so we get

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b.
  \]

  This completes the proof.
</p>
<h2 id="alternate-proof">Alternate Proof<a href="#alternate-proof"></a></h2>
<p>
  The above sequence of theorems is not the only way to arrive
  at <a href="#theorem-4">Theorem 4</a>.  There are other ways to
  reach this result as well.  Let us briefly discuss another such
  proof.  From <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a> we know that \( a
  \cdot b \) is the additive inverse of \( a \cdot (-b).  \)  In a very
  similar way, we can show that \( (-a) \cdot (-b) \) is also the
  additive inverse of \( a \cdot (-b).  \)  The proof goes as follows:

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) + a \cdot (-b)
    = (-a + a) \cdot (-b)
    = 0 \cdot (-b)
    = 0.
  \]

  Note that we used <a href="#theorem-2">Theorem 2</a> again for the
  last equality.  So now we know that both \( (-a) \cdot (-b) \) and
  \( a \cdot b \) are additive inverses of \( a \cdot (-b).  \)  Does
  this mean that \( (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b?  \)  Yes, since the
  additive inverse of an element is unique in a ring.  Let us prove
  this now.

  Let \( b \) and \( c \) be additive inverses of \( a.  \)  Then \( a
  + b = b + a = 0 \) and \( a + c = c + a = 0.  \)  Using this, we get

  \[
    b = b + 0 = b + (a + c) = (b + a) + c = 0 + c = c.
  \]

  Since \( (-a) \cdot (-b) \) and \( a \cdot b \) are additive
  inverses of the same element \(a \cdot (-b) \) and since the
  additive inverse of an element is unique in a ring, it follows that

  \[
    (-a) \cdot (-b) = a \cdot b.
  \]

  Note that we do not need <a href="#theorem-1">Theorem 1</a> in this
  alternate proof but we introduced a new theorem about the uniqueness
  of the additive inverse to complete this proof.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  Theorems 1 to 4 establish certain algebraic properties that hold in
  any ring.  Although these results were proven abstractly for rings,
  they reflect properties we are already familiar with from our
  experience with numbers.  For example, in the ring of integers, we
  observe \( -(-2) = 2 \) which is a specific case
  of <a href="#theorem-1">Theorem 1</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, <a href="#theorem-2">Theorem 2</a> confirms the
  well-known fact that multiplying any integer by \( 0 \) yields
  \( 0.  \)  For example, \( 2 \cdot 0 = 0.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Then <a href="#theorem-3">Theorem 3</a> implies the rule that
  multiplying a positive number by a negative number yields a negative
  result.  For example, \( 2 \cdot (-3) = -(2 \cdot 3) = -6.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Finally, <a href="#theorem-4">Theorem 4</a> implies that the product
  of two negative numbers is positive.  For example, \( (-2) \cdot
  (-3) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6.  \)
</p>
<p>
  These familiar results are not limited to the ring of integers.  The
  results hold in any ring, including polynomial rings, rings of
  integers modulo a fixed positive integer and many other algebraic
  systems.  These results demonstrate how the ring axioms formalise
  familiar arithmetic rules within a more general algebraic framework.

  A field has exactly two ideals: the zero ideal, which contains only
  the additive identity and the whole field itself.  These are known
  as trivial ideals.  Further if a commutative ring, with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities, has no ideals other than the
  trivial ones, then it must be a field.  These two facts are elegant
  in their symmetry and simplicity.  In this article, we will explore
  why these facts are true.  Familiarity with algebraic structures
  such as groups, rings and fields is assumed.

<p>
  A left ideal of a ring \( R \) is a subset \( I \subseteq R \) such
  that \( I \) is an additive subgroup of \( R \) and for all \( a \in
  I \) and \( r \in R, \) we have \( r \cdot a \in I.  \)  We say that
  a left ideal absorbs multiplication from the left by any ring
  element, or equivalently, that it is closed under left
  multiplication by any ring element.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, a right ideal of a ring \( R \) is a subset \( I
  \subseteq R \) such that \( I \) is an additive subgroup of \( R \)
  and for all \( a \in I \) and \( r \in R, \) we have \( a \cdot r
  \in I.  \)  We say that a right ideal absorbs multiplication from the
  right by any ring element, or equivalently, that it is closed under
  right multiplication by any ring element.
</p>
<p>
  In a commutative ring \( R, \) every left ideal is also a right
  ideal and vice versa.  This is because for all \( a \in I \) and \(
  r \in R, \) we have \( r \cdot a = a \cdot r.  \)  Therefore, when
  working with commutative rings, we do not need to distinguish
  between left and right ideals and we simply refer to them as ideals.
  In this case, the ideal is said to absorb multiplication by any ring
  element, or equivalently, it is said to be closed under
  multiplication by any ring element.
</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-ideals">Examples of Ideals<a href="#examples-of-ideals"></a></h2>
<p>
  Consider the set of even integers

  \[
    \langle 2 \rangle = \{ 2n : n \in \mathbb{Z} \}.
  \]

  This is an ideal of \( \mathbb{Z}.  \)  Indeed, if we multiply any
  even integer by any integer, the result is an even integer.  In
  other words, the set of even integers absorbs multiplication by any
  integer.  Equivalently, the set of even integers is closed under
  multiplication by any integer.

  Let us see another example.  Consider the ring of polynomials in the
  indeterminate \( t \) with integer coefficients, denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}[t].  \)  The set

  \[
    \langle 2, t \rangle = \{ 2f + tg : f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[t] \}
  \]

  is an ideal of \( \mathbb{Z}[t].  \)  Every element of this ideal is
  a linear combination of \( 2 \) and \( t \) with polynomial
  coefficients.  If we take any element \( 2f + tg \in \langle 2, t
  \rangle \) where \( f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[t] \) and multiply it by any
  polynomial \( h \in \mathbb{Z}[t], \) we obtain \( 2fh + tgh, \)
  which is again an element of \( \langle 2, t \rangle.  \)  Hence \(
  \langle 2, t \rangle \) absorbs multiplication by any element of \(
  \mathbb{Z}[t], \) i.e. it is closed under multiplication by elements
  of \( \mathbb{Z}[t].  \)

  For the sake of brevity, we assume the following standard results.
</p>
<p id="zero-multiplication">
  <strong>Proposition 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring.  Then, for all \( a \in R, \) we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p id="principal-ideal">
  <strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring and let \( a \in R.  \)  Then

    \begin{align*}
      I_L &amp;= \{ r \cdot a : r \in R \}, \\
      I_R &amp;= \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}
    \end{align*}

    are respectively a left ideal and a right ideal of \( R.  \)  If \(
    R \) is commutative, then \( I_L = I_R \) and we write

    \[
      \langle a \rangle = \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}
    \]

    and say that \( \langle a \rangle \) is an ideal of \( R \)
    generated by \( a.  \)
  </em>
</p>
<h2 id="ideals-of-fields">Ideals of Fields<a href="#ideals-of-fields"></a></h2>
<p>
  In this section, we show that a field \( K \) has only two ideals:
  \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) itself.
</p>
<p>
  Clearly \( \{ 0 \} \) is an ideal of \( K, \) as it satisfies the
  definition of an ideal.  It is the trivial additive subgroup of \(
  K \) and by <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>, for
  all \( r \in K, \) we have \( r \cdot 0 = 0 \in \{ 0 \}.  \)
</p>
<p>
  Now \( K \) is also an ideal of itself.  Since \( K \) is an additive
  group by the definition of a field, it is an additive subgroup of
  itself.  Moreover, as a field, \( K \) is closed under
  multiplication, so for all \( a, r \in K \) we have \( a \cdot r \in
  K.  \)
</p>
<p>
  We will now show that \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) are
  the <em>only</em> ideals of \( K.  \)  Let \( I \) be an ideal of \(
  K.  \)  There are two cases to consider: \( I = \{ 0 \} \) and \( I
  \ne \{ 0 \}.  \)  Suppose \( I \ne \{ 0 \}.  \)  Then there exists a
  non-zero element \( b \in I.  \)  Since \( b \ne 0 \) and \( K \) is
  a field, \( b \) has a multiplicative inverse \( b^{-1} \in K.  \)
  Since \( b \in I, \) \( b^{-1} \in K \) and \( I \) is closed under
  multiplication by any element of \( K, \) we have

  \[
    1 = b \cdot b^{-1} \in I.
  \]

  Now, let \( c \in K.  \)  Since \( 1 \in I, \) \( c \in K \) and \(
  I \) is an ideal of \( K, \) we get

  \[
    c = 1 \cdot c \in I.
  \]

  Thus \( K \subseteq I \) and since \( I \subseteq K \) by
  definition, we conclude \( I = K.  \)  Therefore the only ideals of
  \( K \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( K \) itself.
</p>
<h2 id="rings-with-trivial-ideals">Rings With Trivial Ideals<a href="#rings-with-trivial-ideals"></a></h2>
<p>
  We now show that if \( R \) is a commutative ring with \( 1 \ne 0 \)
  and the only ideals of \( R \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and \( R \) itself,
  then \( R \) must be a field.  To do this, we first show that every
  non-zero element of \( R \) has a multiplicative inverse in \( R.  \)
  Let \( a \in R \) with \( a \ne 0.  \)  We now show that there exists
  a multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in R.  \)
  By <a href="#principal-ideal">Proposition 2</a>, the set

  \[
    \langle a \rangle = \{ a \cdot r : r \in R \}.
  \]

  is an ideal of \( R.  \)  Since \( a = a \cdot 1 \in \langle a
  \rangle, \) we have \( \langle a \rangle \ne \{ 0 \}.  \)  By
  assumption, the only ideals of \( R \) are \( \{ 0 \} \) and
  \( R, \) so it must be that \( \langle a \rangle = R.  \)  Therefore
  \( 1 \in \langle a \rangle \) and

  \[
    1 = a \cdot s
  \]

  for some \( s \in R.  \)  Thus \( a \) has a multiplicative inverse
  \( s \in R \) and this holds for every non-zero \( a \in R.  \)
</p>
<p>
  The remaining properties of fields, namely, associativity and
  commutativity of addition and multiplication, the existence of
  distinct additive and multiplicative identities, the existence of
  additive inverses and the distributivity of multiplication over
  addition, are inherited from the ring \( R.  \)  Therefore \( R \) is
  a field.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  To summarise, any commutative ring with distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities that has only trivial ideals is a field
  and every field has only trivial ideals.
</p>
<p>
  Note that every field is also a commutative ring with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities.  Therefore, we can say that
  every field is a commutative ring with distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities and only trivial ideals and vice versa.
  It is neat how the two facts align so nicely.

  In this article, we explore a few well-known results from abstract
  algebra pertaining to fields and integral domains.  We ask ourselves
  whether every field is an integral domain and whether every integral
  domain is a field.  We begin with the definition of an integral
  domain, discuss a few established results and then proceed to answer
  these questions.  Familiarity with algebraic structures such as
  rings and fields is assumed.

<h2 id="definition-of-integral-domain">Definition of Integral Domain<a href="#definition-of-integral-domain"></a></h2>
<p>
  An <em>integral domain</em> is a commutative ring, with distinct
  additive and multiplicative identities, in which the product of any
  two non-zero elements is also non-zero.
</p>
<p>
  Equivalently, an integral domain is a commutative ring, with
  distinct additive and multiplicative identities, such that if the
  product of two elements is zero, then one of the elements must be
  zero.
</p>
<p>
  Using standard notation, we can write that a commutative ring
  \( R \) is an integral domain if \( 0 \ne 1 \) and for
  \( a, b \in R, \)

  \[
    a \ne 0 \text{ and } b \ne 0 \implies a \cdot b \ne 0
  \]

  or equivalently,

  \[
    a \cdot b = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0.
  \]

  There are many other alternative ways to define an integral domain
  which are all equivalent.  In a ring \( R, \) a <em>zero
  divisor</em> is a non-zero element \( a \in R \) such that there
  exists a non-zero element \( b \in R \) with \( ab = 0.  \)  With
  this definition of a zero divisor, we can define an integral domain
  to be a unital commutative ring, with \( 0 \ne 1, \) that has no
  zero divisors.
</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-integral-domain">Examples of Integral Domains<a href="#examples-of-integral-domain"></a></h2>
<p>
  The ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an integral domain since
  the product of two non-zero integers is non-zero.  The field of
  rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) is also an integral domain.  The
  ring of polynomials in the indeterminate \( t \) with coefficients
  in an integral domain \( R, \) denoted \( R[t], \) is an integral
  domain as well.
</p>
<p>
  The ring of integers modulo 5, denoted \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \) is an
  integral domain.  However, the ring of integers modulo 6, denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}_6, \) is not an integral domain since \( 2 \cdot 3 = 0 \)
  in \( \mathbb{Z}_6.  \)  In other words, \( \mathbb{Z}_6 \) has zero
  divisors, namely \( 2 \) and \( 3, \) so it is not an integral
  domain.  In fact, the ring of integers modulo \( n, \) denoted \(
  \mathbb{Z}_n \) is an integral domain if and only if \( n \) is
  prime.
</p>
<h2 id="known-results">Known Results<a href="#known-results"></a></h2>
<p>
  For the sake of brevity, we assume the following known results.
</p>
<p id="zero-multiplication">
  <strong>Proposition 1.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( R \) be a ring.  Then, for all \( a \in R, \) we have

    \[
      a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p id="cancellation-property">
  <strong>Proposition 2.</strong>
  <em>
    Let \( D \) be an integral domain.  Then, for all \( a, b, c \in D \) such
    that \( a \ne 0, \) we have

    \[
      a \cdot b = a \cdot c \implies b = c.
    \]
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The second result is also known as the <em>cancellation property of
  integral domains</em>.
</p>
<h2 id="on-distinct-identities">On Distinct Identities<a href="#on-distinct-identities"></a></h2>
<p>
  We have been mentioning the distinctiveness of the additive and
  multiplicative identities as a property of an integral domain.  Some
  texts express this more concisely by saying that an integral domain
  is a <em>non-zero</em> unital commutative ring without zero
  divisors, i.e. the zero ring \( \{ 0 \} \) is excluded from the
  definition.
</p>
<p>
  This follows directly from
  <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>.  If
  \( 0 = 1 \in R, \) then for all \( r \in R, \) we get

  \[
    r = r \cdot 1 = r \cdot 0 = 0
  \]

  which means that every element of \( R \) is zero, i.e. \( R = \{ 0
  \}.  \)  To summarise

  \[
    0 = 1 \in R \implies R = \{ 0 \}
  \]

  or equivalently, for a ring \( R \) with unity,

  \[
    R \ne \{ 0 \} \implies 0 \ne 1.
  \]

  Further, if \( 0 \) and \( 1 \) are two distinct elements of
  \( R, \) then \( R \) has at least two elements, so for a ring
  \( R \) with unity,

  \[
    0 \ne 1 \implies R \ne \{ 0 \}
  \]

  Therefore, a ring with unity has distinct additive and
  multiplicative identities if and only if it is a non-zero ring.  This
  is why an integral domain can also be defined as a non-zero unital
  commutative ring without zero divisors.
</p>
<h2 id="every-field-is-an-integral-domain">Every Field Is an Integral Domain<a href="#every-field-is-an-integral-domain"></a></h2>
<p>
  We now show that every field is indeed an integral domain.  Let
  \(F \) be a field and let \( a, b \in F \) such that \( ab = 0.  \)
  There are two cases to consider: \( a = 0 \) and \( a \ne 0.  \)  If
  \( a = 0, \) we are done.
</p>
<p>
  Now suppose \( a \ne 0.  \)  Then by the properties of fields, there exists a
  multiplicative inverse \( a^{-1} \in F \) such that \( a \cdot
  a^{-1} = 1.  \)  Then using the properties of fields, we get

  \[
    b = b \cdot 1 = b \cdot (a \cdot a^{-1}) = (a \cdot b) \cdot
    a^{-1} = 0 \cdot a^{-1} = 0.
  \]

  The last equality follows from
  <a href="#zero-multiplication">Proposition 1</a>.  We have shown
  that if \( ab = 0, \) then either \( a = 0 \) or \( b = 0.  \)
  Therefore, if both \( a \ne 0 \) and \( b \ne 0, \) then it must be
  that \( ab \ne 0.  \)  Therefore \( F \) is an integral domain.
</p>
<h2 id="infinite-integral-domains">Infinite Integral Domains<a href="#infinite-integral-domains"></a></h2>
<p>
  Now we arrive at the next natural question.  Is every integral
  domain a field?
</p>
<p>
  The ring of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an integral domain but it
  is not a field since \( 2 \in \mathbb{Z}, \) but \( 2^{-1} \notin
  \mathbb{Z}.  \)  Therefore, \( \mathbb{Z} \) is an example of an
  infinite integral domain that is not a field.
</p>
<p>
  Next we ask ourselves: Is every infinite integral domain not a
  field?  Not quite!  Some infinite integral domains are, in fact,
  fields.  This follows directly from the result in the previous
  section.  Every field is an integral domain and there are plenty of
  infinite fields, so they must all be integral domains too.  Consider
  the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \) or the field of
  complex numbers \( \mathbb{C}.  \)  Since these are fields, they are
  also integral domains.  So, clearly, there are infinite integral
  domains that are also fields.
</p>
<h2 id="every-finite-integral-domain-is-a-field">Every Finite Integral Domain Is a Field<a href="#every-finite-integral-domain-is-a-field"></a></h2>
<p>
  We will now turn our attention to finite integral domains.  Is every
  finite integral domain a field?  Yes!  This can be shown as follows.
</p>
<p>
  Let \( D \) be a finite integral domain.  Let \( a \in D \) with \(
  a \ne 0.  \)  Consider the set

  \[
    A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication, every element of
  \( A \) belongs to \( D, \) so \( A \subseteq D.  \)  Since \( D \)
  is finite, \( A \) is finite too.  Therefore, by the pigeonhole
  principle, there exist integers \( m \gt n \ge 0 \) such that

  \[
    a^m = a^n
  \]

  This equation can be rewritten as

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} \cdot a^n = 1 \cdot a^n.
  \]

  Since \( a \) is a non-zero element of an integral domain, it
  follows that \( a^n \ne 0.  \)  Therefore we can use
  <a href="#cancellation-property">Proposition 2</a> (the cancellation
  property of integral domains) to get

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under multiplication and since \( m - n - 1
  \ge 0, \) it follows that \( a^{m - n - 1} \in D.  \)  Thus every
  non-zero element \( a \in D \) has a multiplicative inverse in
  \( D.  \)  This establishes the multiplicative inverse property of a
  field.
</p>
<p>
  Since an integral domain has distinct additive and multiplicative
  identities, it satisfies two additional field properties: the
  existence of an additive identity and a distinct multiplicative
  identity.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the remaining field properties are inherited from the ring
  structure, i.e. associativity and commutativity of addition and
  multiplication, the existence of additive inverses and the
  distributivity of multiplication over addition all hold in \( D, \)
  since they hold in any ring.  Thus, \( D \) satisfies all the field
  properties.  Therefore \( D \) is a field.
</p>
<h3 id="alternate-proof">Alternate Proof<a href="#alternate-proof"></a></h3>
<p>
  The proof in the previous section presents what I initially came up
  with while working through these concepts and proving these results
  for myself.  However, I later found that there is another proof that
  is quite popular in the literature.  This alternate proof differs in
  one key aspect: it does not invoke the cancellation property of
  integral domains stated in
  <a href="#cancellation-property">Proposition 2</a>.  Let us examine
  this alternate proof.
</p>
<p>
  As before, we consider the set \( A = \{ a, a^2, a^3, \dots \}
  \subseteq D, \) where \( a \in D \) and \( a \ne 0 \) and we obtain
  the equation

  \[
    a^m = a^n
  \]

  for some integers \( m \gt n \ge 0.  \)  As before, we use the fact
  that \( a \) is an element of an integral domain to conclude that \(
  a^n \ne 0.  \)  Now adding the additive inverse of \( a^n \) to both
  sides we get

  \[
    a^m - a^n = 0.
  \]

  Using the distributivity property of rings, we get

  \[
    a^n (a^{m - n} - 1) = 0
  \]

  Since a ring is closed under addition and multiplication, both \(
  a^n \) and \( a^{m - n} - 1 \) belong to \( D.  \)  As \( D \) is an
  integral domain and \( a^n \ne 0, \) we conclude that \( a^{m - n} -
  1 = 0.  \)  Therefore \( a^{m - n} = 1.  \)  Since \( m - n \ge 1, \)
  we can write:

  \[
    a \cdot a^{m - n - 1} = 1.
  \]

  Therefore every non-zero element \( a \in D \) has a multiplicative
  inverse in \( D.  \)  The remaining properties of a field are
  established in the same manner as in the previous section.  Hence,
  if \( D \) is a finite integral domain, then it is also a field.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>
  We now summarise all the results here before concluding the article:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Every field is an integral domain.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every <em>finite</em> integral domain is a field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some infinite integral domains are not fields.  A convenient
    example is the set of integers \( \mathbb{Z}.  \)
  </li>
  <li>
    Some infinite integral domains are fields.  Every infinite field,
    such as \( \mathbb{Q}, \) \( \mathbb{R} \) or \( \mathbb{C} \) is
    an example.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is worth reiterating here that the fourth result in the summary
  above follows from the fact that every field is an integral domain.
  These results reveal how structure and size interact in algebraic
  systems.  It is interesting how simply being finite guarantees that
  an integral domain is a field.

  One thing I love about Python is how it comes with its very own
  built-in zen.  In moments of tribulations, when I am wrestling with
  crooked code and tangled thoughts, I often find solace in its
  timeless wisdom.  Here's a glimpse of the clarity it provides:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>python3 -m this | grep e-</kbd>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Indeed, there is one and only one <em>obvious</em> way to write the
  number 1 in Python, like so:
</p>
<pre><samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>--(...==...)</kbd>
1</samp></pre>
<p>
  You may, quite naturally, place several ones adjacently to produce
  larger integers:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>&gt;&gt;&gt; <kbd>--(...==...)--(...==...)</kbd>
2</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  And so on, ad infinitum, or until your heap collapses like a poorly
  made soufflÃ©.  Now, the "pre-decrement operator" at the beginning is
  entirely optional, much like the plus sign when you write "+5
  biscuits" in a letter to your grandmother.  It's not wrong, but it
  is unnecessary.  So unless you want to look peculiar to your
  colleagues, you would likely want to adopt a more conventional
  style, such as this:

  Now, all computer programs are, in some sense, just a long, earnest
  stream of bits.  It is currently fashionable to bundle these bits
  into groups of eight and write them as integers.  Following this
  trend, we can compute absolutely anything that is computable as long
  as we know exactly what integers to write.  Now, I wouldn't want to
  bore you with the finer details of computer science, not in this day
  and age, fascinating as they may be.  I trust you are quite capable
  of drawing the rest of the f... well, <em>feathered</em>, nocturnal
  bird.  Once you've grasped the basics, a typical first Python

  Now you might be wondering if this is <em>really</em> the way one
  ought to write production Python code.  Isn't it too much trouble to
  type those dots over and over again?  Not if you remap your
  <kbd>tab</kbd> key to type three dots, of course.  But I understand
  not everyone likes to remap their keys like this.  In particular,
  there exists a peculiar species of mammal known to remap their
  <kbd>tab</kbd> key to parentheses.  They claim it leads to
  enlightenment.  Such enlightened living forms may find the following
  program more convenient to type:
</p>
<pre class="wrap"><code>exec('%c'*((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))%(((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))--(()==()),*(((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),)*((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))**((()==())--(()==()))--((()==())--(()==())--(()==())),((()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))*((()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==())--(()==()))--(()==())))</code></pre>

  This program is functionally equivalent to the earlier one.  But
  Python isn't meant for enlightenment.  It's meant for getting things
  done.  And to get things done, code should be readable, maintainable
  and ideally not resemble an ancient summoning ritual.  That's why I
  personally prefer the earlier style, the one with the ellipses.  It
  gracefully avoids the disconcerting void that lurks within the
  parentheses.  After all, programs must be written for people to read
  and only incidentally for machines to execute.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I must emphasise that you should never deploy code like
  this in production.  If you plan to write code like this for your
  production CGI scripts, I implore you to add some ellipses for
  logging.  When dung inevitably collides with the fan, you'll be
  immensely glad you scattered some useful logs amidst the ellipses
  that hold together your business logic.  With that small piece of
  unsolicited advice, I'll end this brief distraction from scrolling
  through endless arguments on Internet forums.  Happy coding and may
  your parentheses stay balanced (and may your ellipses be the
  punctuation that ...
  <!-- ).  Now, I can sleep peacefully!  -->
</p>
<!--
  For the enlightened folks who are offended by the penultimate
  paragraph, lighten up!  I am no stranger to the fine art of nested
  parentheses.  This very blog is crafted with an abundance of them,
  all forged through the mighty steel and bank machinery.

<title>More Contrast, Please</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>
  So you have decided to go with a dark theme for your website.  Great
  choice!  I love dark themes too!  My journey with computers began
  with monochrome CRT monitors, where white text was displayed on dark
  background.  I am still very fond of that colour scheme.  Done well,
  dark themes can be elegant and easy on the eyes.  But there is a
  common pitfall that I see all too often in modern web design &ndash;
  the overuse of low-contrast colour schemes.  This is something worth
  keeping in mind while crafting a new theme.
</p>
<p>
  Take a look at this example where the text colour
  is <code>#777777</code> and the background is <code>#222222</code>:
</p>
<p style="background: #222222; color: #777777; padding: 1em; text-align: center; font-size: 1rem; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif">
  The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
</p>
<p>
  I am hoping that most people would agree that the colour contrast
  above is too low.  I certainly find it uncomfortable to read.
  However, the situation becomes a bit less clear with the following
  example, where the text colour is set to <code>#A9A9B3</code> and the background
  is <code>#2A2A2D</code>:
</p>
<p style="background: #2a2a2d; color: #a9a9b3; padding: 1em; text-align: center; font-size: 1rem; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif">
  The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
</p>
<p>
  The above example is, in fact, based on a real website I came across
  today.  Now this is definitely better than the first example and I
  am sure some people would find this perfectly acceptable.  However,
  I still find this uncomfortable to read.  In fact, I have realised
  that as I get older, I need a higher contrast ratio to make the text
  more comfortable to read.
</p>
<p>
  I would suggest that any colour choices for foreground text and
  background page colours should, at the very least, meet
  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-enhanced">Web
  Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AAA</a>
  recommendations.  This means the contrast ratio for normal-sized
  text against the background should be at least 7:1.  There are also
  the slightly weaker Level AA guidelines, which require that
  normal-sized text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.  That
  said, I personally recommend aiming for a 7:1 contrast ratio
  regardless.
</p>
<p>
  The first example above has a contrast ratio of just 3.6:1, meaning
  it fails to meet both the Level AA and Level AAA requirements.  The
  second example, on the other hand, has a contrast ratio of
  6.1:1.  While it satisfies the Level AA requirements, it still falls
  short of meeting the Level AAA standards.
</p>
<p>
  To calculate the contrast ratio according to
  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G17.html#tests">WCAG
  contrast formula</a>, use one of these tools:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="contrast.html">My Colour Contrast Calculator</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If we improve the contrast for the second example above, we would
  need to choose a brighter shade for the text, such as
  <code>#B7B7BE</code>.  On the dark background <code>#2A2A2D</code>,
  this results in a contrast ratio of 7.2:1.  Here is how it looks:
</p>
<p style="background: #2a2a2d; color: #b7b7be; padding: 1em; text-align: center; font-size: 1rem; font-family: helvetica, sans-serif">
  The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
</p>
<p>
  I definitely find this much easier to read.  If you are developing a
  dark colour theme for your web page or software, I request you to
  run your colours through a contrast calculator tool and ensure the
  contrast ratio is greater than 7:1.  Anything less and the theme
  might become uncomfortable for people like me.  Small adjustments
  like this can significantly improve readability and comfort for your
  readers.
