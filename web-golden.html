<h1>Web Golden</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 30 Jan 2022</div>
<p>
  In a recent online discussion about simple static websites, Chris
  Chapman <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30139081">posted</a>
  this quite clever comment:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Firm supporter of Web Pi (3.14159).  When it comes to building for
  the web today, I'm always amazed that "so much can be done with so
  little" and yet the default is the opposite - "so much is needed to
  deliver so little" - so irrational!  Where did we go wrong?  I
  wonder what Web Euler (2.71828) would have looked like?
</blockquote>
<p>
  I enjoyed the amusing play on the terms "Web 2.0" and "Web 3.0" as
  well as the irony-infused pun involving the word "irrational".  I
  piled on to the witty wordplay with my own comment where I remarked
  how my favourite phase of the web was Web Golden
  (<a href="phi.txt">1.61803</a>).  I will elaborate here what that
  phase of the web looked like and why I was fond of it.
</p>
<h2 id="fascinating-realisation">Fascinating Realisation<a href="#fascinating-realisation"></a></h2>
<p>
  I believe I was fortunate enough to grow up during a time when the
  web was a very diverse place full of various eccentric digital
  gardens.  I was introduced to the world wide web around 1999.
  Access to the Internet was very limited where I lived.  My friends
  and I would visit so-called Internet caf&eacute;s and shell out a
  significant chunk of our pocket money for just an hour of Internet
  usage.
</p>
<p>
  I was already quite familiar with computers then but the Internet
  and the world wide web were completely new to me.  Until then,
  thanks to my <a href="fd-100.html">prior exposure</a> to the
  Logo programming language, I had only considered computers to be a
  device for problem solving and recreation.  However, the Internet
  showed me that computers were very flexible and malleable
  communication devices too.  It was a fascinating realisation!
</p>
<p>
  While on the Internet, I used to spend most of my time browsing
  websites and joining various chat forums where I could talk to other
  programmers from all over the world.  I learnt a lot about the world
  and its various cultures by talking to them.  I met people who wrote
  their own full blown chat clients, people who were nearing
  retirement after having programmed about twenty different
  microcontrollers throughout their careers, people who developed
  software for global positioning systems and so on.  These
  experiences broadened my horizons.  I could see that my enthusiasm
  for computers could one day lead to a fulfilling career.
</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity<a href="#simplicity"></a></h2>
<p>
  The world wide web was a delightful place.  There were no major
  social media websites yet.  I believe the closest thing to social
  media we had back then
  was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990125095557/http://www.geocities.com/">Geocities.com</a>
  where we could create our own websites for free.  One could also
  host their websites on shared website hosting providers for a fixed
  annual fee.  Some also hosted their websites on servers running in
  their own houses.
</p>
<p>
  Most websites were made up of static HTML pages.  Some websites had
  tiny guestbooks that allowed a little user-generated content.  I
  remember some of the website hosting providers made it really easy
  to add guestbooks, even for someone with no programming experience.
  All one needed to do was create an HTML page that contained
  a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element with the <code>action</code>
  attribute set to a URL of a CGI script provided by the hosting
  provider.  The CGI script would accept every comment submitted via
  the guestbook and automatically insert the new comment into a static
  HTML page.  The good scripts would escape the special characters in
  the comments properly before saving it in the static comments page.
  But the poor ones would let any script kiddie deface the guestbook
  page by inserting cleverly crafted HTML snippets or JavaScript code
  within the comments.  That would be the first lesson on cross-site
  scripting for many of us in those days.
</p>
<p>
  While most personal websites were static in nature, the motivated
  web developers would teach themselves enough programming to add
  little pieces of dynamic functionality by writing CGI scripts.  Many
  used PHP instead which was much easier to write code in and deploy.
  I taught myself ASP to develop dynamic pages.  It allowed me to
  write my own guestbook page and a dynamic quiz application for the
  visitors of my website.
</p>
<p>
  Despite various types of dynamic functionality offered by the
  websites, the web was simple.  Web pages with infinite scrolling was
  unheard of.  Visiting useful websites did not result in the web
  browser loading dozens of massive JavaScript files in the
  background.  Web developers were used to doing less with less.  But
  the old web had its own problems too.  Just like how the current web
  is riddled with banner advertisements, the old web too was riddled
  with pop-ups!  A prevalent user-hostile trend back then involved web
  pages creating new pop-ups for advertisements.  They would often
  clutter the desktop because the major web browsers back then would
  create a new desktop-level window for each popup.
</p>
<h2 id="nostalgia">Nostalgia<a href="#nostalgia"></a></h2>
<p>
  Although these old, simple and crude websites can still be found in
  certain corners of the web, the mainstream web no longer looks like
  this.  Websites are generally heavier and more complex these days.
  Talking about the old web today only serves as nostalgia for people
  like me who grew up during that magical time.  One might argue that
  the world wide web today is much more advanced and has much more
  utility than the old web I am reminiscing about here.  That is true.
  The web today is a very versatile tool of great utility.  The web
  today is a powerful agent that is shaping our civilisation and
  influencing how societies evolve and function.  Indeed, the web was
  quite limited in terms of utility back then.  Online banking was not
  prevalent.  Electronic commerce was very new and clunky.  The most
  practical utility of the old web I can recall involved publishing
  and retrieving university exam results and even that was painfully
  slow.  It would take a minute or two for university pages to load
  over dial-up connections.
</p>
<p>
  However, what the web of the 90s lacked in terms of utility, it more
  than compensated by being a fertile ground for creativity.  Thanks
  to the early web, many computer enthusiasts, including me, learnt to
  build their first few websites by writing one line of HTML at a
  time.  To write a few lines of HTML code in a text editor and then
  watch the web browser render that code as a glorious web page full
  of colours, images and text was a magical feeling.  I do think that
  was the golden era of the web.  It was quirky and yet beautiful.  It
  was limited and yet diverse.  It was the sweet spot between Web 1.0
  and Web 2.0.  It was Web 1.61803!  It was Web Golden!
