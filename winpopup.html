<h1>WinPopup</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 10 Dec 2001</div>
<p>
  While browsing the <code>C:\Windows</code> directory of the Windows
  98 system in our dorm room, I came across an interesting program
  named <code>Winpopup.exe</code>.  It is a tiny little program that
  can be used to send messages from one Windows system to another on
  the same local area network (LAN).

  Windows networking supports the notion of workgroups where one or
  more computers may logically belong to a common group.  Computers
  belonging to the same workgroup can share resources such as files,
  printers, etc. with each other.  To see the workgroup your computer
  belongs to, go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt;
  Network &gt; Identification and see the value of the field named
  "Workgroup".  By default, this value is "WORKGROUP" but it can be
  changed to create smaller working groups of computers.
</p>
<p>
  Apart from sending messages to a specific computer, WinPopup
  supports sending messages to an entire workgroup of computers too.
  An example of this is shown later in this post.

<p>
  To start WinPopup, go to My Computer &gt; C: &gt; Windows, then
  click on the link that says "Show Files", then scroll down to the
  bottom to find WinPopup.exe and finally double click on it to start
  it.  Alternatively, you can also type <kbd>win</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd>,
  type <code>winpopup</code> and type <kbd>enter</kbd>.

  To send a message, simply click on the envelope icon, select one of
  the radio buttons depending on whether you want to send a message to
  a specific computer or an entire workgroup, then type the name of
  the computer or workgroup you want to send your message to and then
  type the message to be sent.

<p>
  When you are ready to send the message, just click on the OK button.
  If everything goes fine, a message box confirming that the message
  was successfully sent should appear.

<p>
  It is worth noting here that the recipient also needs to have
  WinPopup running in order to read messages successfully.  I found
  this tool only a few days ago and I already find this tool to be
  very useful for communicating with other users of Windows systems.
