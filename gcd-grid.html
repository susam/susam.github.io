<h1>GCD Grid</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 07 Oct 2021</div>
<p>
  I recently completed reading the book <em>Introduction to Analytic
  Number Theory</em> written by Tom M. Apostol and published in 1976.
  It is a fantastic book that takes us through a breathtaking journey
  of analytic number theory.  The journey begins with simple
  properties of divisibility and ends with integer partitions.  During
  this journey, we learn about several fascinating concepts such as
  the M&ouml;bius function, Dirichlet multiplication, Chebyshev's
  functions, Dirichlet characters, quadratic residues, the Riemann
  zeta function, etc.  An analytic proof of the prime number theorem
  is also presented in the book.
</p>
<p>
  One of the things about the book that caught my interest from the
  very beginning was its front cover.  It has a peculiarly drawn grid
  of white boxes and red empty regions that looks quite interesting.
  Here is the grid from the front cover of the book:
</p>

    to Analytic Number Theory</em>

</figure>
<p>
  Can we come up with a simple and elegant rule that defines this
  grid?  Here is one I could come up with:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <em>
    Number the columns in the grid 0, 1, 2 and so on from left to
    right.  Number the rows in the grid 0, 1, 2 and so on from bottom
    to top.  Let \( (x, y) \) represent the cell at column \( x \) and
    row \( y.  \)  Then a box exists at \( (x, y) \) if and only if \(
    \gcd(x, y) \ne 1.  \)
  </em>
</div>
<p>
  We define \( \gcd(x, y) \) to be a nonnegative common divisor of \(
  x \) and \( y \) such that every common divisor of \( x \) and
  \( y \) also divides \( \gcd(x, y).  \)  Let us now see if we can
  explain some of the interesting properties of this grid using the
  above rule:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      When \( x = 0 \) and \( y \ne 1, \) we get \( \gcd(x, y) =
      \lvert y \rvert \ne 1, \) so the entire column at \( x = 0 \)
      has boxes except at \( (0, 1).  \)  Similarly, the entire row at
      \( y = 0 \) has boxes except at \( (1, 0).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The cell \( (0, 0) \) has a box because \( \gcd(0, 0) \ne 1.  \)
      In fact, \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0.  \)  This follows from the definition
      of the \( \gcd \) function.  We will discuss this in more detail
      later in this post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every diagonal cell \( (x, x) \) has a box except at
      \( (1, 1) \) because \( \gcd(x, x) = \lvert x \rvert \) for all
      integers \( x.  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The grid is symmetric about the diagonal cells \( (x, x) \)
      because \( \gcd(x, y) = \gcd(y, x).  \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A column at \( x \) has exactly one cell below the diagonal if
      and only if \( x \) is prime.  For example, check the column for
      \( x = 5.  \)  It has exactly one cell below the diagonal.  We
      know that \( 5 \) is prime.  Now check the column for
      \( x = 6.  \)  It has four cells below the diagonal.  We know
      that \( 6 \) is not prime.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Let us now elaborate the second point in the list above.  If \(
  \gcd(0, 0) \) is \( 0, \) then \( 0 \) must divide \( 0.  \)  Does \(
  0 \) really divide \( 0?  \)  Isn't \( 0/0 \) undefined?  Yes, even
  though \( 0/0 \) is undefined, \( 0 \) divides \( 0.  \)  We say an
  integer \( d \) divides an integer \( n \) when \( n = cd \) for
  some integer \( c.  \)  We have \( 0 = 0 \cdot 0, \) so indeed
  \( 0 \) divides \( 0.  \)
</p>
<p>
  We have shown that \( 0 \) divides \( 0 \) but we have not shown yet
  that \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0.  \)  Is \( \gcd(0, 0) \) really \( 0?  \)
  Every integer divides \( 0, \) e.g. \( 1 \) divdes \( 0, \) \( 2 \)
  divides \( 0, \) \( 3 \) divides \( 0, \) etc.  There does not seem
  to be a greatest common divisor of \( 0 \) and \( 0.  \)  Shouldn't
  \( \gcd(0, 0) \) be called either infinity or undefined?  No, we
  need to look at the definition of \( \gcd \) introduced earlier.  As
  per the definition, every common divisor of integers \( x \) and \(
  y \) must also divide \( \gcd(x, y).  \)  With this requirement in
  mind, we see that \( \gcd(0, 0) \) must be \( 0.  \)  This definition
  also makes \( \gcd(n, 0) = \gcd(0, n) = \lvert n \rvert \) for all
  integers \( n.  \)  Further, this definition makes B&eacute;zout's
  identity hold for all integers.  B&eacute;zout's identity states
  that there exists integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( mx + ny
  = \gcd(x, y).  \)  Indeed if we have \( \gcd(0, 0) = 0, \) we get \(
  0 \cdot 0 + 0 \cdot 0 = 0 = \gcd(0, 0).  \)
</p>
<p>
  That's all I wanted to share about the front cover of the book.
  While the front cover is quite interesting, the content of the book
  is even more fascinating.  I found chapters 12 and 13 of the book to
  be the most interesting.  In chapter 12, the book teaches how to
  prove that the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \) vanishes at
  every negative even integer \( s.  \)  Through several contour
  integrals and clever use of Cauchy's residue theorem, it shows in
  the end that \( \zeta(-2n) = 0 \) for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \dots.  \)  In
  chapter 13, the book shows us how to obtain zero-free regions where
  \( \zeta(s) \) does not vanish.  The book exposes various subtle
  nuances of the zeta function with great rigour and thoroughness.
  Results like \( \zeta(-1) = -1/12 \) that once felt mysterious look
  crystal clear and obvious after working through this book.  I
  strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn analytic
  number theory.
