<h1>Debian Releases and Toy Story</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 09 Feb 2020</div>
<p>
  Did you know that Debian releases are named after characters from
  the <em>Toy</em> Story films?  I began using it with Debian 4 (Etch)
  in 2007.  It was named after Etch A Sketch, one of Andy's toys.  The
  latest release, Debian 10 (Buster), is named after Andy's pet puppy.
</p>
<p>
  The name Debian itself is a portmanteau of the names Ian Murdock
  (the creator of Debian) and Debra Lynn (his then-girlfriend, later
  ex-wife).  As a result, this name has been called a <em>curiously
  personal name for such a community-oriented project</em>.

  I was using Fedora and Ubuntu in 2007 when a member of a local Linux
  User Group (LUG) introduced me to Debian.  Its simplicity and
  elegance, its vast package repository along with its stability and
  robustness made me an ardent user of this distribution pretty
  quickly.  Thirteen years later, I still use Debian on my laptops,
  Linode servers and virtual machines.  I run my personal website on
  Debian too.  I have got so used to <code>apt-get install</code> and
  the large number of tools available in the Debian repositories that
  I keep a Debian virtual machine or a remote shell handy when I am
  working on a non-Debian system.  Over these years, I have gradually
  moved from GNOME 2 to GNOME 3 and then to Xfce 4.  It really helps
  that Debian still provides an installation CD with Xfce as the
  default.  In case anyone is interested, I have documented and shared
  my <a href="https://github.com/susam/dotfiles/blob/master/docs/debian-setup.md">Debian
  setup notes on GitHub</a>.
