<h1>More Purple Links, Please</h1>
<div>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 03 Apr 2025</div>
<p>
  While I am browsing the Web, one thing I always like to see is a
  page with purple links.  Since the early days of the Web, purple has
  has become the default colour for visited links.  Here's a relevant
  note from the
  <a href="https://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/archives/WWW-TALK/www-talk-1993q2.messages/47.html">changelog</a>
  of NCSA Mosaic 0.13 (1993):
</p>
<blockquote>
  Changed default anchor representations: blue and single solid
  underline for unvisited, dark purple and single dashed underline for
  visited.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Visiting a web page and finding purple links brings a sense of ease.
  The purple links indicate that I am familiar with some of the
  references the web page makes to other articles.  Each purple link
  serves as a small marker of a prior journey, a reminder that I've
  explored certain paths before.  To me, purple links are like
  well-worn books with faded covers and creased spines.  Blue links,
  on the other hand, are like new books, to be opened and explored.
</p>
<p>
  Although I'm quite fond of purple links, I know that not everyone
  shares this sentiment.  Modern web design trends have moved away
  from this tradition, favouring sleek, minimalist aesthetics where
  visited and unvisisted links look nearly the same.  While this can
  be visually appealing, in my opinion, it detracts from the
  experience of using the Web as a source of knowledge.  When links
  look indistinguishable or unconventional, it can be hard to tell
  what I've already read, especially when I am revisiting a topic and
  want to easily spot the links that are new.
</p>
<p>
  Now it is not hard to change the visited link style with a little
  userscript.  For example the following userscript can override the
  website's stylesheet to colour visited links purple again:
</p>
<pre>
<code>// ==UserScript==
// @name Purple Links
// @match *://*/*
// ==/UserScript==
document.head.appendChild(document.createElement('style'))
document.head.lastElementChild.innerHTML = 'a:visited {color: #518}'</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This little userscript should work well on most web pages with light
  backgrounds.  But if a web page uses a dark theme or a custom colour
  scheme, then the above userscript may need adjustments to either
  handle other colour schemes gracefully.
</p>
<p>
  To me, the purple links serve as small reminders of all the digital
  paths I've already walked.  I wish more websites would honour this
  convention.  More purple links, please.
